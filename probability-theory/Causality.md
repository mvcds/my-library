Is the influence by which one [[Event]], process or [[State]] (a cause) contributes to the production of another [[Event]], process or [[State]] (an effect) where the cause is partly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly dependent on the cause.

In general, a process has many causes, which are also said to be causal factors for it, and all lie in its past.

An effect can in turn be a cause of, or causal factor for, many other effects, which all lie in its future
