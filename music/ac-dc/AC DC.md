One of the 3 Young brothers had a band called [[Easybeats]], and then he created a band with his brothers.

When he left he suggested his siblings to keep rocking - create their own band to play songs from artists like [[Chuck Berry]], but they soon found their own style.

The name AC/DC comes from the idea that they would create "electrical rock". Accidentally it's also a slang for homosexuality

After their first international album ([[High Voltage]]) they opened shows for [[Black Sabbath]], [[Aerosmith]] and [[Kiss]]
