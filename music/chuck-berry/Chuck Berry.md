A compositor and singer who has refined and developed [[R&B]] towards creating a new genre of music in the late 50s. For that he's considered by many the father of [[Rock and Roll]].

Maybe the reason why he has reached fame, is because he would ignore the black movement of the [[time]] when it was favoring himself. This gave him access to playing to white people and writing music which would be interpreted by players like [[Elvis Presley]].

He has been in jail twice, the second one by moving a minor to work in one of his sex clubs.
