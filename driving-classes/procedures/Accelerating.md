The gist is using the [[Clutch]] together with the [[Accelerator]] by finding the middle point of the clutch slowly before speeding up - either those [[Pedals]] avoid the car dying

1. Find the appropriate rotation for the [[Gear]] based on your situation ([[Unparking]], on the road, [[Unparking from an uphill|uphill]], etc)
2. [[Accelerator|Accelerate]] calmly
	- If on 1st [[Gear]], you need to [[Clutch|unclutch]] to not let the car go silent
