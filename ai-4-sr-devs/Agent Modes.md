Some [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]] have "modes" that are dedicated to do something, some of the common ones:

- Ask: used to answer doubts, explore [[Domain Model|Domains]], [[system-design-interview/concepts/Design|Design]] solutions, etc without changes on code
- Edit: used to perform local changes
- Agent: used to perform changes on all the [[Code|Codebase]] as if it was a person, usually integrated to the [[Integrated Development Enviroment|IDE]]
