[[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]] can work together towards out [[Goal|Goals]], similar to [[Microservice Architecture]]

---

[[9 - Agent-Assisted Frontend|Assistants]] are weaker form of [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]], they are not [[Autonomy|autonomous]], nor can [[thinking|think]] (due to the lack of [[State]]) or use tools

Assistants also tend to be [[Determinism|non-deterministic]], while agents make a large part of their output to be deterministic

[[Multi-Agent System|MAS]] implies planning how [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]] will interact and coolaborate

- Define [[Actors and Roles|Roles]]
- Sequence [[Gist Task|Tasks]]
- Manage [[Asset|Resources]]: [[Time]], [[Data]], shared resources, etc
- Put control mechanisms: to supervise and control

---

Some [[Multi-Agent System|MAS]] techniques

- Separate planning from execution
- Use a model for analyse the [[System Requirement|Requirements]] and another to create [[Prompt|Prompts]]
- Apply [[Retrieval-Augmented Generation|RAG]]
- [[Monitoring|Monitor]] and [[Measure]]
- Separate writing and reviewing
- [[Optimization]] of each other

---

[[Scalability]] issues

- Scalability itself
- Computational [[Complex|Complexity]]: more agents, the harder
- [[communication|Communicational]] overhead
- [[Security]] and [[Fault Tolerance|Robustness]]
- [[Interoperability]]
- Complex Coordination

---

[[Multi-Agent System|MAS]] challenges

- [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]] [[Behavior]]
- [[Emergency|Emergent]] Phenomena
- [[Scalability]]
- [[Uncertainty]] and limited [[Information]]
- [[Heterogeny]] of agents: 
- Coordination and [[communication]]

---

Why we need [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]] [[Architectural Framework|Frameworks]]

- It handles the problems with [[Scalability]]
- Standard [[communication]] [[Communication Protocol|Protocols]]
- It handles the challenges
- Ready for production

Coordinators

When to use them

- Multiple steps [[Complex]] workflows
- Needs centralized control
- Different [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]] have different specialties

Pros

- Workflow Control
- Easy [[debug|debugging]] and [[Monitoring]]
- Delegate responsibility

Cons

- Unique Point of Failure
- It can create bottlenecks
- It can become complex
