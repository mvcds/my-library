Some [[Prompt|Prompting]] tips for [[Security]]

- Make yourself aware of [[Vulnerability|Vulnerabilities]]
	- "Is this [[Code]] safe?"
- Incorporate security as a [[Cross-Functional Requirement]]
	- "As a security expert, given this [[User Story]], add the [[Acceptance Criteria]] to make sure that we're following the best practices of security. Focus only one the ones specific for the story, ignore the ones at the application level, such as [[Authentication]], [[Actors and Roles|Roles]] and permissions, or [[Encryption]]"
- Mention a [[Architectural Framework|Framework]]
	- "According to [[Open Web Application Security Project|OWASP]] top 10, what are the main vulnerabilities of this code? Give me concrete examples to justify it, and propose solutions to each of them"
- Find and solve concrete [[designing-data-intensive-applications/concepts/three-types-of-faults/Failure|Bugs]]
	- "How to solve this?"
