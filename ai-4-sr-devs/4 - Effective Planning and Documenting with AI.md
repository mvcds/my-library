Diagrams as Code (DaC)

[[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]] can be used to generate code-like diagrams or [[Code]] based on them

- They can be versioned
- We can automate documenting of programs
- The team can better collaborate

---

For startups or new products, the stages of defining the [[System]] is very different, the focus is on iterate fast to validate [[Hypothesis]]

Below, how we can do effective planning

---

1 - Defining and [[system-design-interview/concepts/Design|Designing]] the [[System]]

We can use the [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]] to understand the [[Domain Model|Domain]]

Good to give it a specific role, and details which kind of outcome we expect

An important part of such investigation is search for solutions that were already created:

- For inpiration
- To not reinvent the wheel

This first phase focuses on learning what our domain is about

Good place to think about general [[Cross-Functional Requirement|Cross-Functional Requirements]]

----

2 - Defining [[Use Case|Use Cases]]

We rise the level of [[carreer/development/system-design/concepts/Abstraction|Abstraction]], identifying the different user roles, their [[Use Case|Use Cases]], dependency between things

It might be necessary to intervine manually to correct the route

----

3 - Defining and [[system-design-interview/concepts/Design|Designing]] the [[Data]] [[Domain Model|Model]]

Understand the [[Entity|Entities]] that will be relevant to the [[System]], how they relate to each other and which information we need to hold

[[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]] caan be used to define and  [[system-design-interview/concepts/Design|Designing]] the [[Data]] [[Domain Model|Model]] 


---

4 - [[System]] [[carreer/development/design/Design|Design]] and high-level [[Software Architecture|Architecture]]

The [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]]can help us to [[carreer/development/design/Design|Design]] defined the general [[System]]'s structure including its [[Software Architecture|Architecture]], component distribution, integration with external systems and communication patterns

---

5 - Documentation

Throughout all phases, it's essential to save the information collected and decisions taken. Mainly

- [[C4 Model]] 
- [[Architecture Decision Record|ADR]]
