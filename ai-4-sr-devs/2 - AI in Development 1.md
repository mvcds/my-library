Future enhanced by [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]]

---

An [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]] works as [[Developer vs Architect|Developers]] so devs can work more as managers

---

[[Soft skill|Soft Skills]] will be increasingly more necessary

Seniors should be able to sell their ideas well

Seniors should be able to do the following towards their prefered  [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]]

- Delegate
- Supervise
- Analyze
- Guide

We imagine that in the future [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]] will be single plataform will be able to do everything for us but at this moment, we have to resort to many different tools that gives us a quick overview of what's going on

- it can chat and comment
- has all the context
- it's integrated with the rest of our tools
- 1-click changes
- predefined commnads

[[Integrated Development Enviroment|IDEs]] in 2025

- Multiple [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]]
- Advanced rationalization
- Can use computers
- [[Real-Time]] Voice
- [[10 - Open-Source]]
- "Cheap"

You have to know when to use an [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]] or not to use it, and in case of using it, you must use it for the [[Use Case|Use Cases]] where it makes sense

[[Developer vs Architect|Developer]] Tools (2025)

[QUADRANT OF]

 * Production-Ready vs Prototype
 * Non-Technical vs Technical

Type of [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]]

- Chatbots: not integrated to your [[Code|Codebase]]
- Web [[Integrated Development Enviroment|IDE]]: less control
- AI-Enhanced [[Integrated Development Enviroment|IDE]]: the future
- Autonomous [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]]: simulates a [[Developer vs Architect|Developer]]
