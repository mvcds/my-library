Future enhanced by [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]]

---

An [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]] works as [[Developer vs Architect|Developers]] so devs can work more as managers

---

[[Soft skill|Soft Skills]] will be increasingly more necessary

Seniors should be able to sell their ideas well

Seniors should be able to do the following towards their prefered [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]]

- Delegate
- Supervise
- Analyze
- Guide

We imagine that in the future [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]] will be single plataform will be able to do everything for us but at this moment, we have to resort to many different tools that gives us a quick overview of what's going on

- it can chat and comment
- has all the context
- it's integrated with the rest of our tools
- 1-click changes
- predefined commnads

[[Integrated Development Enviroment|IDEs]] in 2025

- Multiple [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]]
- Advanced rationalization
- Can use computers
- [[Real-Time]] Voice
- [[10 - Open-Source]]
- "Cheap"

Level of [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] [[Code|coding]] tools (2025)

1. Autocompleted code: Copilot, Tobby
2. Tasks: Chat GPT, Aider, 16x Prompt
3. Projects ([[Sofware Development Life Cycle|SDLC]]): Codegen, Sweep, Pythagora
4. Specification to Product AKA Autonomous [[Developer vs Architect|Developers]]: Marbalism, Boltnem, Trickle
5. Teams: Autodev, MetaGPT, MGX

[[Developer vs Architect|Developer]] Tools (2025)

[QUADRANT OF]

- Production-Ready vs Prototype
- Non-Technical vs Technical

---

Type of [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]]

- Chatbots: not integrated to your [[Code|Codebase]]
- Web [[Integrated Development Enviroment|IDE]]: less control
- AI-Enhanced [[Integrated Development Enviroment|IDE]]: the future
- Autonomous [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]]: simulates a [[Developer vs Architect|Developer]]

Pillars for the effective usage of [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]]

- [[Prompt]]
- Tool (the agent itself)
- Context

---

Types of [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agents]]

- Executor Model: focus on performing tasks
- Generative Model: focus on creating "ideas"

---

Some patterns for [[Prompt Engineering]]:

- Clarify: allow the [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]] to ask you questions
- Aim: set up a goal
- Specific: be detailed with steps
- Exemplify: give examples and expected outputs
- Focus: made it explicit who is the [[15 - Know your audience|audience]]

---

Advanced Techniques

- Select the right type of [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]]
- Write in English
- [[Save Useful Prompts]]
- [[Metaprompting]]
- Question and asking: start debating before taking actions
- Pros and Cons: ask for evaluation and alternatives
- Chain-of-Thought (COT): step to step rationalziations

---

The 3S Principles to Executor Models

- Simple
- Specific
- Short

---

Tips

- Iterate
- Split the [[Prompt|Prompts]] into smaller "secctions"
  - Starts with the plan
  - Functionality
- Clarity
- Visual error? Screenshot it, and feed the [[Artificially Intelligent Agent|Agent]]
- Ask for reccomendations
- Ask for suggestions on how to improve work by the end of the session
