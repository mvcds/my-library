It has 5 different hypotheses

# Acquisition

**Acquisition** and **learning** are different mental processes - acquisition is similar to what happens when your learning L1, learning is about formal instructions such as grammar rules

# Monitor

The **monitor** acts in a planning, editing, and correcting function when three specific conditions are met: that is,

1. the second [[Language]] learner has sufficient time at his/her disposal
2. he/she focuses on the form or thinks about correctness
3. and he/she knows the rule

There are learners who use the 'monitor' all the time (over-users); those learners who have not learned or who prefer not to use their conscious knowledge (under-users); and those learners that use the 'monitor' appropriately (optimal users)

# Input

The **Input** hypothesis is only concerned with 'acquisition', not 'learning'. The learner improves and progresses when he/she receives second [[Language]] 'input' that is one step beyond his/her current stage of linguistic competence and can understand it, even if (s)he can reproduce it - teachers should aim to give comprehensible Input' 

# Natural Order

The **Natural Order** hypothesis says that each [[Language]] has its own order necessary for `acquisition`. For a given [[Language]], some grammatical structures tend to be acquired early while others are late.

This order seemed to be independent of the learners' age, L1 background, and conditions of exposure. Krashen, however, points out that the implication of the natural order hypothesis is not that a [[Language]] program syllabus should be based on the order found in the studies. In fact, he rejects grammatical sequencing when the [[Goal]] is [[Language]] acquisition.

# Affective Filter

the **Affective Filter** hypothesis embodies Krashen's view that a number of 'affective variables' play a facilitative, but non-causal, role in L2 acquisition.

These variables include:
- motivation
- self-confidence
- and anxiety
