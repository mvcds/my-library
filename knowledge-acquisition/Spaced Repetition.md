A [[knowledge|learning]] technique to take advantage of [[Spacing Effect]] by presenting target-concepts repetitively in longer intervals

The repetition cannot be too far apart - if we leave the content too long between memory-building sessions, we start seeing diminishing returns.

Ideally, make time for memorization a few days per week.
