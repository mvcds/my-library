- `a priori` a piece of [[knowledge]] which can be reached regardless of the exposition of the experience, for instance using reason
- `a posteriori` is a one that can only be derived from [[Empiricism]]

For instance knowing that a king governed from 1910 to 1936 is `a posteriori` knowlege because nobody could know this by reason alone
