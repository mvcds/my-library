# A Universal [[System]]  for Organizing Digital [[Information]]

![[the-para-method-lists.png]]

## Aim

- **[[universal]]**: it can have any kind of [[Information]]
- **flexible**: can be used in many kinds of projects or activitities
- **[[simple]]**: minimal management
- **[[actionable]]**: integrates [[task management ]]and [[project management]] easily
- **cross-plataform**: can be used in any [[app]]
- **[[outcome]]-oriented**: [[Information]] should support delivery of [[work]]
- **[[modular]]**: different levels of details should be shown or hidden depending on the task at hand
- **opportunistic**: takingh advantage of what is already is place as opposed as having to learn new tricks

## Meaning

**P.A.R.A. stands for Projects — Areas — Resources — Archives**, the four top-level categories that encompass every type of [[information]] you might encounter in your work and life

- A **project** is “a series of tasks linked to a [[Goal]], with a [[deadline]].”
- An **area of responsibility** is “a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over [[time]].”
- A **resource** is “a topic or theme of ongoing interest.”
- **Archives** include “inactive items from the other three categories, like projects that have been completed or become inactive; areas that you are no longer committed to maintaining; resources that you are no longer interested in

## Project vs Area

A [[Goal]] is a [[discrete event]] hat will happen in a specific moment at [[time]]

An area has a [[standard]] to be maintained, without a deadline. The standard continues forever, so you have to "prune" it regurlarly.

> Publishing a book is a project, whereas [[Writing]] is an area

A project without a corresponding [[Goal]] is known as a “hobby.” If you’re not committed to or haven’t fully articulated the outcome you want, you must be doing it just for fun.

And if you have a [[Goal]] without a corresponding project, that’s called a “dream.” You may desire it with all your heart and soul, but without an active project, you are not in fact currently making any progress.

## Organization

> I’ve noticed that people tend to use different organizational schemes in every program they use

Each tool might be better for specialized tasks but if you have to tweak your system to fit them, you're forcing your brain too much. 

### Principles

![[the-para-method-organization.jpeg]]

- uses the number 4 as a guidepost: as this is the limit of most of our [[cognitive process]]es, , from working memory to object-tracking to rapid enumeration
-  perfectly mirrors your task management and project management systems
-  separates actionable and non-actionable [[Information]]: allows [[Progressive Disclosure]]
