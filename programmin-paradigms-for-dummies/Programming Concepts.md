There are $n$ concepts which a [[Programming Paradigm]] can be based on, for a [[Programming Language]] to be useful.

The author claims that a language should focus on a main paradigm and have some small touches of another one, in order to be useful. In this mindset we can have $2^{n}$ combinations

We then get a set containing a number, way bigger than $n$ but way less than $2^{n}$, of useful paradigms.

If we mix too much paradigms in a language, it becomes hard to use it in real life
