#fact 

According to [[Wendy Brown]], in a [[Liberalalism|liberal]] [[democracy]], everyone has to create their own [[philosofy/Value|Values]][^1] but due to [[Capitalism]] we have many agents trying to hammer their values into us, making it harder:

- [[Government]]
- [[Religion]]
- [[Race]]
- [[Nationalism]]
- etc

It contrasts [[Downstream of Values by Theocracy]]

[^1]: Creating their own values is in accordance with [[Nietzsche]]
