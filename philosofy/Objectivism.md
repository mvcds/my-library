Its main tenants:

- Reality exists independently of consciousness
- Human beings have direct contact with reality though perception
- One can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic
- The proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (the rational egoism)
- Morality only exists when individual rights are respected according to laissez-faire capitalism
- Art transforms humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally
