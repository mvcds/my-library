A [[Philosofy]] [[system]] created by [[Ayn Rand]]

> The concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the [[Moral]] purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute

#quote 

# Main tenants:

- Reality exists independently of consciousness
- Human beings have direct contact with reality though perception
- One can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic
- The proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (the rational egoism)
- Morality only exists when individual rights are respected according to  [[laissez-faire capitalism]]
- Art transforms humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally

# Values

- Reason
- Purpose
- Self-esteem

>      Man—every man—is an end in himself, not a means to the ends of others; he must live for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself; he must work for his rational self-interest, with the achievement of his own happiness as the highest moral purpose of his life.

The essence of objectivism while standing on one foot (by the author):

1. Metaphysics: Objective [[reality]] -> "Nature to be commanded, myst obeyed"
2. Epistemology: Reason -> "You can't eat your cake and have it too"
3. Ethics: Self-Interest -> "Man is an end in himself"
4. Politics: Capitalism -> "Give me liberty or give me death"

Objectivism rejects any form of [[Determinism]], the belief that man is a victim of forces beyond his control (such as God, fate, upbringing, genes or economic condition)

The only social [[system]] that bars physical force from human relationships is[[ laissez-faire capitalism]]. [[Capitalism]] is a system based on the recognition of individual rights, including property rights, in which the only function of the government is to protect individual rights, i.e., to protect men from those who initiate the use of physical force.”

Thus Objectivism rejects any form of [[collectivism]], such as [[fascism]] or [[socialism]]. It also rejects the current “mixed economy” notion that the government should regulate the economy and redistribute wealth.
