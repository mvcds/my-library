A [[Psycology]] book by Dr [[Julie Smith]] to give people the [[tool|tools]] that they need to go through [[life]].

As a set of tools, it doesn't solve all problems life throws at you. Each of them has to be trained individually and in its own pace.

It's better to practice them **before** needing them, in the same way that it's better to get get phisically healthyt before getting sick - when you're sick it's very hard to try to improve your health.

The author has used those tools with herself, and her atients, and they work for most but might need some adjustment to apply to other individuals.
