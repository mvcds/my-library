> We have power over our [[mood]]

Because [[2 - Mood is not a genetic brain trait]], it acts similar to our body temperature.

Our temperature fluctuates out of our control, responding to internal factors (infections, exercises, etc), and external ones (weather, forgetting the jacket).

And we can control our temperature by noticing it, and taking actions, like putting the jacket to meet your temperature needs[^1].

[^1]: [[4 - Low mood tends to be more due to unmet needs]]
