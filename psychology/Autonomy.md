Is about a person’s ability to act on his or her own [[my-library/philosofy/Value|Values]] and [[Goal|interests]]. Taken from ancient [[Greek]], the word means ‘self-legislation’ or ‘self-governance.’ Modern political thought and bioethics often stress that individual autonomy should be promoted and respected. But it can be difficult to pin down exactly what autonomy means and [[Five whys|why]] it matters.

Looked at psychologically, autonomy is made up of a set of [[skill]]s and [[behavior|attitudes]]. Relevant skills include the ability to reason, to appreciate different points of view, and to debate with others. In order to do these things, the autonomous person must have a sense of self-worth and self-respect. Self-[[knowledge]] is also important, including a well-developed understanding of what matters to him or her.

Some social circumstances can help us be more autonomous, and others can undermine autonomy. To develop these abilities and attitudes, a person needs the opportunity to consider meaningful alternatives, both opportunities for action and ways of [[think|thinking]] about what matters. This depends on dialogue between persons: we often learn about ourselves through others’ responses; it is easier to reconsider our values when we hear other people’s reasons and encounter other ways of looking at the world.

By contrast, oppressive social attitudes, rigid social hierarchies and lack of meaningful choices make it harder to develop autonomy and to act on our own interests and values.
