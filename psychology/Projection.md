A a [[Defensive Behavior|defense mechanism]] in which the [[ego]] defends itself against unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves and attributing them to others.

For example, a bully may project their own feelings of vulnerability onto the target, or a person who is confused will project their own feelings of confusion and inadequacy onto other people.

It incorporates [[blame shifting]] and can manifest as [[shame dumping]].

Projection has been described as an early phase of [[Introjection]]
