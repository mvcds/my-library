aliases: [Handling anxiety]

> [[Anxiety]] has two neural pathways, one that starts at [[Cortex]] and passes through the [[Amygdala]], and another that starts straight into the amygdala

Handling anxiety depends on where it starts

- Cortex: we react to an event; mindfulness, meditation, activelly stop thinking about the anxiety cause, etc
- Amygdala: we imagine that something bad will happen (ike being attacked by a mob when talking in public[^ 1]; progressive exposure to the anxiety cause so to get used to it

[^1]: The brain understands it as being exposed for an imaginary attack
