1. ** Impatience is not a lack of patience**:[^1] impatience is a mental/physical process which gets triggered in the right circumstances and motivates to take very specific actions
2. **Impatience is triggered when we have a [[Goal]], and realize it’s going to cost us more than we thought to reach it**:  for instance, if we're driving back home and found ourselves stuck in traffic
3. **Impatience motivates us to reduce the costs of reaching our goal, or to switch goals**: When we realize it’s going to [[cost]] us more than we thought to get to our goal, our mental gears start spinning. We start looking for ways to avoid the additional costs in time, pain, distraction, credibility or opportunity.
4. **Impatience and indignation are a potent combination**: We’re in special danger of making an [[rationality|irrational]] choice when we run into unexpected costs, _and we think the extra costs are someone else’s fault_.
5. **We're more likely to feel impatience when we have more options**: due to the [[Paradox of Choice]]
6. **Impatience can cost us**:
7. **Impatience can benefit us**:  Impatience is in our [[Emotion|Emotional]]-[[behavior|behavioral]] repertoire for a reason: When hunter-gatherers spent two days pursuing game and found nothing, it was good to grow impatient. It was good to consider the possibility that another food-acquisition strategy (gathering) might be better at that point.

How to fight it: [[Knowledge]]!

-   What is my goal?
-   What did I think it was going to cost to reach this goal?
-   What are the additional costs I’m now aware of?
-   Am I blaming others for these extra costs?
-   Is it truly their fault?
-   Is it worth taking on even more costs just to teach them a lesson?
-   Do I have too many options?
-   Should I find a way to limit my exposure to new options?
-   Are there ways to reduce the costs of reaching this goal?
-   Is it time to abandon this goal?
