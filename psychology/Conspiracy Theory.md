The [[theory]] that some [[social]], [[economics]] or [[political]] conspiracy is taking place. 

With so many out there, the chances are that you probably believe in one of them, but most likely you wouldn't call yourself a "theorist" on it because **you believe it**.

There are 3 theoris why people are drawn to them:

- [[Loser Theory]]: people feel that they don't have the power (or rather that they lost it), so they seek reasons to justify their power
- [[Social Theory]]: as people are social animals, they bound over their conspiracy e.g. flat earth society
- [[Uncertanty Theory]]: because people's senses are all they can "trust", they dismiss facts from "trusted sources" e.g. government, [[science]], jornalism, for instance, in a massacrre that happened on the US, some people said it was a government cover up because "it didn't look right" (the perp was a white middle-aged man)
