The study that shows that **because** is a powerful word because it gives a reason to what we're doing (when asking for favors, or during [[negotiaion]])[^1] even when that reason is non-sense

In 1977 [[Ellen Langer]] and her research team at [[Harvard University]] would spot someone waiting at the library copy machine and walk over with the intention of cutting the person in line. Then, the researcher would look at the innocent bystander and ask them one of three questions.

1.  **Version 1 (request only):** “Excuse me, I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine?”
2.  **Version 2 (request with a real reason):** “Excuse me, I have 5 pages. May I use the xerox machine, because I'm in a rush?”
3.  **Version 3 (request with a fake reason):** “Excuse me, I have 5 pages. May I use the xerox machine, because I have to make copies?”

Despite the 3rd version being obvious (if you're on the line, you are there to make copies), the second and third performed similarly.

The study became famous because it uncovered one of the most powerful words we use to drive our [[behavior]]: **because**.

Langer's work proved that **as long as we could justify a behavior in our brains (_“I'm doing this because…”_), we would perform the behavior even if the reason didn't make sense.**

> A well-known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a [[reason]]. People simply like to have reasons for what they do
