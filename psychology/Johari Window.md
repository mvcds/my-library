- Arena (Open): Everyone agrees on those qualities. We move within this area with [[freedom]]
- Façade (Hidden): Qualities selected by the subject, but not by any of their peers. These are things the peers are either unaware of, or that are untrue but for the subject's claim.
- Blind Spot:  
  Qualities not selected by subjects, but only by their peers go here. These represent what others perceive but the subject does no
- Unknown (Shadow): Qualities not selected by anyone. They represent the subject's [[behavior|behaviours]] or motives that no one participating recognizes – either because they do not apply or because of collective ignorance of these traits.
