# How to overcome it

1. Recognize you're procrastinating
	- Fill your day with low-priority tasks.
	- Leave an item on your To-Do list for a long time, even though it's important.
	- Read emails several times over without making a decision on what to do with them.
	-  Start a high-priority task and then go off to make a coffee.
	-  Fill your time with unimportant tasks that other people ask you to do, instead of getting on with the important tasks already on your list.
	- Wait to be in "right mood," or wait for the "right time" to tackle a task.
2. Work Out WHY You're Procrastinating
	- Is the task boring or unpleasant?
	- Are you organized enough? Or overwhelmed?
	- Do you have ADHD, OCD, anxiety or depression, or are you impulsive?
3. Adopt Anti-Procrastination Strategies
	- Forgive yourself for procrastinating in the past
	- Commit to the task. Focus on doing, not avoiding.
	- Promise yourself a reward.
	- Ask someone to check up on you
	- Act as you go
	- Rephrase your internal dialog. The phrases "need to" and "have to," for example, imply that you have no choice in what you do. This can make you feel disempowered and might even result in self-sabotage . However, saying, "I choose to," implies that you own a project, and can make you feel more in control of your workload.
	- Minimize distractions
	- Aim to "eat an elephant beetle" first thing, every day!
	- Focus on the long game
	- Identify the unpleasant consequences of avoiding the task
	- Look at its meaning and relevance
