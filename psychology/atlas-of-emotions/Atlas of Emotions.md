The http://atlasofemotions.org/ was inspired by [[The Dalai Lama]] conversation with the [[Emotion]] scientist [[Paul Ekman]].

According to it, most emotions researchers agree on these five [[Universal Emotions]]: emotions that all humans, no matter where or how we were raised, have in common.

- [[Anger]]
- [[Disgust]]
- [[Fear]]
- [[Sadness]]
- [[Enjoyment]]
