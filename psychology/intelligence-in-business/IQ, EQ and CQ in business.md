We tend to put [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]] above other forms of intelligence like [[Emotional Quotient|EQ]] and [[Curiosity Quotient|CQ]] when we talk about what makes for top-performers or desirable hires.

Individuals with high EQ are less likely to experience stress and anxiety, which allows them to manage high-pressure situations and make consistently good decisions. High EQ also indicates strong interpersonal skills, which are essential to managing teams, collaborating with peers and colleagues, and building beneficial relationships.

In a [[carreer/business/Service|Service]]-based [[economy]] that is increasingly automating technical tasks but reserving relationship-based responsibilities for humans, EQ is essential for nearly every worker. It governs human interaction.

CQ is similarly associated with great leadership. Individuals with high CQ are creative, inventive, and better equipped to tolerate ambiguity. Predictably, high CQ correlates with a larger investment in [[education]] and expertise over [[time]]. This is actually not the same as IQ, which measures raw intelligence but not the drive to seek out more knowledge.

EQ and CQ are critical not only to individual performance, but to overall [[business|company]] performance as well.

High-EQ leadership fosters a better company [[culture]], which results in happier employees, better talent retention, and more overall collaboration. High CQ leadership breeds innovation and an entrepreneurial mindset, which creates opportunities for new tools, processes, inventions, and even spin-outs that make businesses more sustainable, competitive, and likely to remain relevant.
