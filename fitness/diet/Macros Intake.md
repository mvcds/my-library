According to [9 tips to build muscles while losing fat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VnXyHPmbY0), [[Protein]] is the main [[Macronutrient|macro]] for drive the intake

$$ Protein = Pounds * 0,73g $$
$$ Round Off = Total Daily Calories - (Protein * 4)$$
The amount of [[Fat]] and [[Carbohydrate|Carbs]] is flexible but a good start is splitting the "Round Off" (calories)  equally

$$ Fats = {{RoundOff * 0,5} \over 9} $$
$$ Carbs = {{RoundOff * 0,5} \over 4} $$
