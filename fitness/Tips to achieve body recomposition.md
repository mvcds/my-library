[[Body Recomposition]] can be achieved using the following tips

1. [[Weight on the scale doesn't matter]]. ![[Weight on the scale doesn't matter#Better alternatives]]
2. Focus on building [[Muscle|Muscles]], burning [[Fat]] is secondary. What will help with burning fat is your [[Diet]]
3. Incorporate [[Rep Periodization]]
4. Keep cardio low impact and low intensity so it doesn't impact your workout. Just walk, in order to recover.
5. Depending on your body composition, your primary goals might be different (gravityfransformation.com/macro-calculator)
   - If you haven't lift weights for a while or have lots of fat (for men, "lots of fat" means over 15%, for women over 24%.), you want to lose fat
     - [[Cutting]] 5 to to 30%
   - If you are not on the "lots of fat" group
     - [[Bulking]] 5%
6. Control the [[Macros Intake]] based on [[Protein]]
7. Track calories because this process is based on being precise with the [[Macronutrient|Macros]]
   - At least temporarily
   - Repetition of food means make tracking short, while variety causes the tracking process to be longer (a month?)
8. [[Sleep]] properly as it affects the process. Rest the same group with at least 48h between muscle groups
   - [[Muscle Recovery]]
   - Burning fat
   - Recovery
9. Adjust mainly by changing the intake of [[Fat]] and [[Carbohydrate|carbs]]
   - Not gaining muscle: [[Caloric Surplus]] by 200 to 300 cal per day
   - Not losing fat: [[Caloric Surplus]] by 200 to 300 cal per day
