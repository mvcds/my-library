A training might be split into three distinct phases, in different proportions, so to change the stimulus according to [[Goal|Goals]]

| Phase                       | [[Hypertrophy Phase\|Hypertrophy]]                     | [[Strength Phase\|Strenght]]                                                              | [[Deload Phase\|Deload]]                                               |

| Notes                       | Keeps muscle under fatigue; increases metabolic stress | Allows [[Central Nervous System Efficiency\|CNS]] and muscles to recover fully            | Enough rest to avoid fatigue but keep the body active while recovering |
