Alternative for [[Test Directly Method]] to find out the [[One-Rep Max|1RM]] of an exercise

This is safer. 

1. Picking up a weight you think you can manage to do the exercise
2. Doing 6-10 reps to failure to find out the [[Last Successful Rep|LSR]] in proper form
3. Use the following formula

$$ 1RM = Weight * (1 + LSR * 0,0333) $$
