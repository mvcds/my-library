#concept 

A series of 4 numbers (or "X"[^1]) to indicate [[time|how long]] the exercise take

The numbers represent in this order:

- Eccentric Movement: lowering phase
- Bottom Pause
- Concentric Movement: lifting phase
- Top Pause

Changes on the cadence change the stimulus without needing to change the weight

- Explosive (eg `2-0-X-1`): good for power
- Controlled [[Hypertrophy Phase|Hypertrophy]] (eg `3-1-1-0`): focuses on time under tension
- Eccentric-focused (eg `4-0-1-0`):  more muscular damage, use less load

[^1]: For "explosive" i.e. as fast as you can
