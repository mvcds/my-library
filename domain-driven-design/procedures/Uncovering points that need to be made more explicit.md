A mix of the following has to happen

- Listening to the [[domain-driven-design/concepts/Ubiquitous Language|Language]]
- Scrutinising awkwardness in the [[carreer/development/design/Design|Design]]
- Spotting contradictions in an [[Domain Expert|expert]]'s [[linguistics/Statement|Statements]]
- The literature of the [[Domain Model|Domain]]
- Performing lots of experiments
