#procedure in [[1 - Crunching Knowledge]]

"Translating" the [[Knowledge]] to a diagram a way that devs and [[Domain Expert|Domain Experts]] will understand is about making things explicit everybody. Such diagrams will eventually become [[code]].

The [[Shipping Example]] shows a way to do it, but keep in mind that this is a simple example. It's up to you to do it _only_ when the [[Domain Model]] will be enriched.
