There are at least 3 ways to make [[7 - Association|associations]] more tractable, in order to make them more easy to communicate and implement, normally highlighting trully natural bidirectional associations

1. Imposing a transversal direction, to show naturallity of the association[^1] 
2. Adding a qualifier, effectivelly reducing multiplicity
3. Eliminatig nonessential associations

In the example below, we see how to make a N:N relationship become 1:N by first adding a direction, then adding a qualifier

[^1]: When looking at the model, it's more natural to ask in some directions than another e.g. "which country was George Washington president of?" rather than "which person was US' president?"
