> The most significant [[complexity]] of many [[Software|Applications]] is not technical. It is the [[domain]] itself, the activity or business of the user. When this domain complexity is not handled in the [[carreer/development/design/Design|Design]], it won't matter that the [[infrastructure|infrastructural]] [[Technology]] is well conceived. A [[Success|succesful]] design must systematically deal with this central aspect of the software.
