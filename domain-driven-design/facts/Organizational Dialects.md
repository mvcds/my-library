#fact in [[0 - Domain-Driven Design]]

Professionals have [[Jargon|Jargons]] that might be impenetrable for other people, but within an [[business|organization]], the same happens. Each team develops their own [[Dialect]] to talk about the [[Domain Model]].

Often interacting [[team|teams]] needs some sort of translation between such dialects because they lack a common [[domain-driven-design/concepts/Ubiquitous Language|language]] that unify them all, the problem is that [[Translation blunts communication and make knowledge crunching anemic]]
