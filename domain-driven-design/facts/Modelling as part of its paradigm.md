#fact in [[0 - Domain-Driven Design]]

It's easier to do [[domain-driven-design/procedures/Model-Driven Design|Model-Driven Design]] when the [[Programming Language]] allows us to "translate" the concepts to their [[code]] and [[Data Structure|Data Structures]].

This can happen with any language that has modelling as part of its [[Model Paradigm|paradigm]][^1], for instance [[Prolog]], and naturally any on [[[Object-Oriented Programming|OOP]].

On the other hand, the [[Procedural Paradigm]] does not allow for modelling because it's all about instructions, which happen to be over [[Data Structure|Data Structures]] which can resemble models.
