#concept and #fact in [[2 - A model expressed in software]]

[[domain-driven-design/procedures/Model-Driven Design|Model-Driven Design]] and [[Rule-based system]] are model paradigms i.e. different ways to [[Model]] problems, it doesn't matter which expresses the [[Domain Model]]

It's also possible to mix them, which often happens by using different technologies, but the concepts of the model should persist through them
