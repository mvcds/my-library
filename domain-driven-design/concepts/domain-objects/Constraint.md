#concept in [[2 - Making implicit concepts explicit]]

A [[Function|Method]] that implements a constraint, that is, reinforces a [[Invariant]] so to make code more aligned with the [[Domain Model|Model]], and give room for it to become more complicated, if needed

It is not a proper [[Domain Object|object]] in the [[Object-Oriented Programming|OOP]]-sense but is part of the [[carreer/development/programming/design-principles/domain-driven-design/Ubiquitous Language|Ubiquitous Language]]
