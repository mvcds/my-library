A [[Modularity|Module]] is a meaningful part of the [[Domain Model|model]] that helps reducing [[cognitive load]] by splitting the domain concepts into smaller [[1 - Isolating the Domain|subsystems]] in a way that allows us to:

2. Focus on the [[Association|relationships]] of the modules without worrying about the details
