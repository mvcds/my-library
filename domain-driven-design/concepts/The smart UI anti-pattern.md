#concept in [[0 - Domain-Driven Design]]

When the [[Policy and Details|Business logic]] is put in the [[UI]]

| Props                                                                       | Cons                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Immediate and hight productivity, for simple projects                       | Hard to integrate with other applications but from the database           |
| Less skill required                                                         | Lack of re-use and of [[Abstraction]] of behaviour                            |
| Defects in requirements are quickly fixed, so it can be used for [[prototype]]s | The quick prototyping reach a natural limit because it's hard to keep it |
| Expanding with simple behaviour is simpler                                  | Things get more [[Complex]] easily without leaving an easy way out                     |
| Good fit for [[Relational Database]]s                                          |                                                                           |
| [[4GL]] tools work well                                                         |                                                                           |
| Handoff is easy, people without context know everything is on the [[UI]]        |                                                                           |
