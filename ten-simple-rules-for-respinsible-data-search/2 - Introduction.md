> As the size and [[Complex|Complexity]] of available [[Dataset|Datasets]] has grown, so too have the [[Ethics|ethical]] questions raised by [[big data]] research. These questions become increasingly urgent as [[data]] and research agendas move well beyond those typical of the computational and [[science|natural sciences]], to more directly address sensitive aspects of human behavior, interaction, and health

This paper is meant as an imperfect guideline to guide researchers and users of data, as to start a debate over how to protect [[Privacy]] and/or use data in an ethical manner.

Such debate is necessary because social and computer scientists start mixing their disciplines, something that takes them out of their confort zone.
