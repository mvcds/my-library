A [[term]] related to the [[evolution|evolutionary]] pace of rival things co-relating due to pressure. That is, when the external bar raises, the pressure just to "get there" elevates, and we must keep up or fail.

The consequence of the Red Queen effect is that the harder a rival tries to get ahead of the first place, the further behind it appears to fall. It is easy to miss the nuance that the bar itself is rising. **Intensification of a rival platform’s efforts to get ahead of others leads to intensification of effort by rivals, gradually raising the bar for them all**.

The name is based on the anecdote in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s Through the Looking-Glass, where two characters were constantly running yet remaining in the same place relative to each other.
