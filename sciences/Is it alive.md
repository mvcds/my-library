![[is-it-alive.png]]

To say something is alive, it's useful for us to look tick some boxes in a list of traits:

- Growth
- Reproduction
- Made of cells (one or more)
- Responds to stimuli
- Ordered and [[complex]]
- Has metabolism
- Maintains homeostasis
- Evolves across generations

The more we check "yes" the more probable we're looking at [[What is life|life]]
