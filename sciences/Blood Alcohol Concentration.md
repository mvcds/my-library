Most people feel drunk at .10 BAC. Your reaction [[time]] is delayed and your muscle control is impaired. You might feel dizzy, nauseous, and have trouble walking.

If two equally-weighted people drink the same in the same time, their BAC, and thus their drunkness, might be different because of several factors, like:

- Differences in [[Body Water Composition]] make male-bodied  dilute the alcohol more
- Male-bodied people have more of the enzyme that metabolises alcohol
- Hormonal changes in female-bodied affect alcohol digestion
- [[16 - Technology in a men's world|Body size matters]], and male-bodied have larger skeletal  frames and muscles, which contributes for alcohol dilution

You can find out how your own BAC would change based on your size, biological sex (i.e., birth sex) and drink choices by using an online BAC calculator (we recommend healthstatus.com). Then, consider the impact of BAC on your body and functioning (health.cornell.edu/alcohol).
