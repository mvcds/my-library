#concept and #fact in [[2 - Writing effective OKRs]]

The two variants of an OKR:

- Commited: we expect to [[Color Grade|score]] 1.0 to not indicate misses (due to errors in planing and/or execution). For that we're willing to adjust schedules and [[Asset|Resources]] to ensure delivery
- Aspirational: we expect an average score of 0.7, as they just describe what we'd like the world to look like, even when we don't have a clue how to get there.
