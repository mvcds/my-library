- [[OpenAI]]: conversation
	- Setup API keys, and limit how much money you want to spend to not be suprised
	- Each message has `role`and `content`, roles
		- user: the person interacting with the [[Artificial Intelligence]]
		- system: provides the AI with context and instructions
		- assistant: the answers from AI
	- The prompt is the array of messages: `messages`
	- The AI's network response is also known as completion
		- The completion is an array of choices
	- We start by setting the `model` and the `messages`
	- The `model`property changes how the AI behaves
		- Tokens are units of text, but according to the `model`they might mean different things
			- A whole word `friendship`
			- A single character `f`
			- Or subwords `friend`, `ship`
		- Each model has different limits on how much tokens can be exchanged
		- Each network request/response uses tokens (request + response)
		- `gpt-3-enconder` package allows to know how much tokens will be used
- [[Deepgram]]: speech recognition
- [[Replicate]]: image analysis (MiniGPT)
- [[LangChain]]: a memory for previous interactions
