Consider dividivind the offending subordinate [[Clause|Clauses]] into separate [[Sentence|Sentences]]

---

**That** and **which** both introduce subordinate clauses.

In some countries, reserve **which** for nonessential subordinate clauses, and use **that** for an essential subordinate clause that the sentence can't live without

If you read a sentence aloud and hear a pause just before the subordinate clause, then use **which**. If you don't hear a pause, use **that**.
