[[Sentence|Sentences]] that start with **There is** or **There are** marry a generic noun to a generic verb.

Removing **There is** replaces the generic subject with a better subject

|Status|Example|
|---|---|
|Bad|There is a variable called `met_trick` that stores the current accuracy.|
|Good|A variable named `met_trick` stores the current accuracy.|
|Good|The `met_trick` variable stores the current accuracy.|

 You can sometimes repair a **There is** or **There are** sentence by moving the true subject and true verb from the end of the sentence to the beginning.
 
 When possible, replacing **There are** with **You** strengthens the sentence

|---|---|
|Bad|There are two disturbing facts about Perl you should know.|
|Good|You should know two disturbing facts about Perl.|
 
If no subject exists, consider creating one
