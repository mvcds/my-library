Talking about what we want to do might happen in an abstract spectrum

- a [[wireframe]] is too concrete, it hides high details
- a text is too abstract, the meaning is lost
- **[[4 - Shaping|shape]]** is something in the middle

# Example

The use case they give is the grid view calendar

- less than 10% of users would use it
- didn't make sense to write a fill calendar due to how much work it would required
