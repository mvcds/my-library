aliases: [Restricted Stock Units, RSU, RSUs]
---

A kind of [[stock]] which is "restricted" to you because it cannot be freely transferred. As such they also do not have any real [[my-library/philosofy/Value|Value]].

They are used by [[business|companies]] as a way to hold employees, as the RSU are converted to real stocks on a [[Vesting|Vesting Date]].

Any unvested RSU is lost (or cancelled) when the employee leaves the company.

# Lifecycle of an RSU

1.  Grant: A company assigns them to their employees, normally using role and tenure as criteria. Employees technically do not get any income at this stage, so no taxation.
2.  [[Vesting]]: The company recognizes the fulfillment of requirements by converting RSUs to [[Stock|Stocks]] which triggers a taxable event. Here each employee gets some taxed income.
3.  Dividend Distribution: Here is the first moment when the company has no control over the former RSU. The dividends of the stock might generate taxable income. At this point you have stocks and as such can sell them or chose different brokers.
4.  Sale/Disposition: When the (former) employee sells the stock, they have a [[Capital Gain]], which is taxable too(?)
