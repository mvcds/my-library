A len is a point of view, you have to combine multiple lenses to see the whole picture.

For instance, when facing a problem (it depends on the problem, of course), people from finance might see this as a finance problem, but operations will see the same problem as an operational problem - both are true but incomplete, you need all relevant pieces in place to find the [[Perfect solutions]]
