You can try to look to a problem and "attack" it from multiple aspects (you challenge yourself into looking for solutions)

A nice idea is try to blowup one of the following aspects:

1. [[0 - 31 Startup business models you must know|Business model]]: reconsider the market and [[strategy]]
2. Revenue: products, pricing, geography and reach
3. Costs: how to eliminate drag to become more efficient - including thinking how your job can be automated!
