The ability to think clearly and [[Reasoning|rationally]], understanding the logical connection between ideas.

In essence, critical thinking requires you to use your ability to reason. It is about being an active learner rather than a passive recipient of information.

Critical thinkers rigorously question ideas and assumptions rather than accepting them at face value. They will always seek to determine whether the ideas, arguments and findings represent the entire picture and are open to finding that they do not.

Critical thinkers will identify, analyses and solve problems systematically rather than by intuition or instinct.
