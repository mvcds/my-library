By the end of 20th century, risk financial behavior led to catastrophic losses.

People do not take rational decisions when emotive with the prospect of getting rich, something that investing makes people think will be the natural course of events.

When bubbles burst, people lose everything.

An example the author gives is about the 2007 house collapse of the US, which caused a global crises.

This can be explained by what [[Raimond Minsk]](?) believes to be the consequences of [[Capitalism]]: as it moves forward it becomes unstable because people and banks can take riskier behaviors regarding borrowing/lending - at some point people cannot afford paying back anymore, entering poverty, and this causes prices to fall, triggering a recession.
