[[Economics]] is a [[Greek]] word that originally related to managing the household. Nowadays it explains differences between [[society|societies]], though on a surface it seems only related to [[Money|Monetary]] questions - like offer and demand, and prices.

And thought such differences are hard to contemplate, economists are asking those questions.
