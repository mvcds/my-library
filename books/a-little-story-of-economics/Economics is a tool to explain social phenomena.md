After WWII, economists turn their thinking to [[Macroeconomics]] and [[Microeconomics]]. One affects the other but their weight is felt differently.

Here is where [[Game Theory]] is invented and this allow us to use [[Economics]] as a tool to explain [[society|social]] phenomena like crime. When you see crime as cost-benefit [[Factorial Analysis|analysis]], you can try to reduce it by making the costs of being caught much higher than than benefits of committing it.

And inequality (especially in global level) is one of the biggest social problems. With many tracing it back to [[Capitalism]].

[[Fidel Castro]] taking of Cuba, for instance, was because according to him, the US exploits poor countries because it is impossible for every nation to be rich.
