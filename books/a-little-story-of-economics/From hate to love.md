[[Aristotle]] was the first known person to reason about [[Money]], he despised people who were producing only for profits (as opposed to supporting their families) and renters.

Christians also used to abominate it. They thought it should only be used to buy and sell goods, but due to renters (and similar) the dynamics of money had changed and some individuals could accumulate it, causing banks to be developed.

Banks allowed [[Mercantilism]] to exist because it linked the rich of a nation to the rich of its merchants, and this led to [[Exploration]].
