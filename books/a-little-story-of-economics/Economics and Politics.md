The US government failed to respond fast to the early signs of recessions, causing the richest country of the world to enter [[The Great Depression]].

But interventions should be thought with care, because some theorists believe that when the government intervenes too much, individual freedom is lost because citizens have to obey totally otherwise they'd risk poverty or worse.

It was clear by now that [[Economics]] and [[Politics]] are distinct but intertwined.

We have bad examples of this happening like in Uganda(?) but also good examples, like South Korea where the government intermission allowed them to grow until a point where such intermission could relax.
