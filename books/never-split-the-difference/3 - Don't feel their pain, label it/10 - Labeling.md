The act of "call out" somebody's else [[Emotion|Emotions]] and repeat them back is a [[10 - Tactical Empathy|tactical]] move, not a strategy - it allows the other to know you [[knowledge|acknowledge]] what they are saying at the same time, buys you time.

The other also understands labeling as a way of you validating what they say[^1], so it makes them less tense[^2]. It shows them we understand.

To label proper you first need to detect the emotion and then use a impersonal pronoun ("it seems", "it sounds", "it looks") so the other know what you're saying is not about you. To make it work, you have to shut up right after i.e. the label is only complete with your final silence.

Labeling can be a short-cut for intimacy.
