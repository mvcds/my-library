To drive his point about [[3 - Black Swan]], the author gives as an example the first hostage-taker who didn't have a demand.

This challenged the [[status quo]] of what police enforcement believed at the time:

1. People want to live
2. Hostage taker always have an escape plan (don't matter how irrealistic)

But the prep actually had done some stuff that later pointed out that he **wanted** be killed by law enforcement, so he didn't **need** an escaple plan and nor making demands because he was not planning to live later.
