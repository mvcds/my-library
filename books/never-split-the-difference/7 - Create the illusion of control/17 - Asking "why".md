Given that an [[16 - "Why" stinks of accusaion]],  you should use this world carefully.

Prefer "what cause you to do it?" over "why did you do it?" when [[15 - Designing calibrated questions]] and normal [[negotiation|converstation]].

Essentially, only use it when the [[Defensive Behavior|defensiveness]] it creates supports the change you want to see (though the author doesn't provide proofs to it) e.g. "why would you do business with me?"
