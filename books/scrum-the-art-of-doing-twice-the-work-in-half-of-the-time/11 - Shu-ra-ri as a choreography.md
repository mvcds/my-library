In the Shu state, you know all the rules and ways and you repeat them, as if they were steps on a choreography, so that your body can assimilate them. You don't divert.

In the Ha state, once you have mastered all the ways, you can innovate, add a new step to the choreography.

In the Ri state, you can put the ways aside. You really dominate the practice and is able to be creative in a unobstructed way, because the knowledge of what the [[Aikido]] - or tango - means is so deep-seated in your been that all your steps manifest the essence of this art.
