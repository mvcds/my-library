We get the impression that we react to situations but we think others are motivated by their personality.

A fun side effect is that, when asked to described our personal characteristics and our friends' peculiarities, we always paint ourselves as more boring.

We assert having way less personality traits than our friends.

When we talk about others, we mention their inherent properties, and we don't see the relation of such properties to the external environment.
