In transport [[system]], for instance, women navigation patterns tend to be more [[Complicated vs Complex|complicated]] because we delegate them child and elderly care, together with a lot of unpaid work, so they spend more time from place to place and need to use more transfer.

Given the [[pay gap]], this implies on them using more public transport, which are also designed to optimize access to workplaces from which they are partially excluded, not to mention that they might be less secure due to arrastments which can sometimes be dismissed as "the transport was too crowed".

As they use less private cars, they tend to walk more too. In streets paved with ice, this leads to diverse accidents which impact their work capacity. This was ignored by [[The default male]] when doing urban planning around this subject because men normally can afford cars, and drive them more often.
