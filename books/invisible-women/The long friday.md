The long Friday was a finish national strike where more than 90% of women didn't do any kind of job (paid or not), and went to rallies. In the following year there was a passed act for gender equality.

But in most countries women relationship with work is more complicated.

As seem in [[Gender neutral with urinals]], we do not give woman the work flexibilization that they need, especially when we consider that Financial [[System|Systems]] tend to ignore unpaid work, and some benefits can only be collected when the values come from the same source.

Women normally have to have multiple income sources to make as much as men, so they get screwed twice: they have less money and many times can't use the same benefits.

Not only this, due to taking care of house, children, etc, they normally go to part part time jobs, which have worse payments, not to mention that for "educated" services (like in an office, as opposed to a waitress), they are pretty rare, so they'd earn less anyway.

On top of this women normally have less free time than men because of unpaid tasks plus the issue of transport discussed on [[Can snow-clearing be sexist?]].
