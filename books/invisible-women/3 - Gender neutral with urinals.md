Some times society tries to do well but due to the [[1 - The default male]] is still the main perspective plus the difficulty of predicting real consequences ([[Black Swan]]?), some "funny" cases happen

For instance, normally women have to queue to go to the toilet (they take longer to get clean, they normally are with kids, they have periods, etc), so when a theater changed "men" and "women" words in its toilets for "gender neutral with urinal" and "gender neutral with cubicles", respectively, what actually happened is that men could go alleviate themselves in two distinct places, overflowing the ladies restroom beyond its capacity.

Bathroom regulations around the world are often stating that the floor space should be 50-50, despite being more advantageous for men - as urinals give us more options to where to pee.

Another example comes from Brazil where social programs normally "promote" mothers to _better_ social houses, away from the favelas[^1], but this means they'll have to commute longer and at the same time lose the communal support from their families, who collectively look after the kids.

This turns moms the only responsible for looking the children and, due to the social house having rules against informal jobs (cutting hair, selling snacks, etc) due to being in a residential area, they can't even get extra money.

So in the end some prefer not to move from the favelas, while others who do tend to give up their formal jobs to be able to work at home.
