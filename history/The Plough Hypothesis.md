First introduced by Danish economist [[Ester Boserup]] in her 1970 book, [[Women’s Role in Economic Development]], the Plough Hypothesis observes that in many pre-industrial societies, women played a major part in tending the land up until the introduction of the plough.

Before the plough was introduced, farming communities used handheld tools like the hoe and the digging stick to prepare the soil. Ploughs changed the game because pulling them requires significant upper body strength, grip strength, and bursts of power — physical abilities that favor men. In farming communities that adopted the plough, women were sidelined from [[Agricultural Revolution|agricultural]] work and kept housebound.

This hypothesis is enforced by the fact that in the nomadic and/or hunter-gathering societies we can observe in modern times, sexual egualitarism is often practiced.While men tend to hunt and women tend to gather, these roles often overlap. Women retain control over the food they gather. Both men and women raise children equally.

Among the Hadza of Tanzania, the !Kung, and other nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes, resources are shared equally. The concept of ownership, when it exists, generally takes the form of being associated with a place or thing rather than possessing it. Hunted or gathered food is shared equally among all members of the tribe. Sometimes, a chief or elder individual will be responsible for divvying out the food, but this authority figure receives as much as the other tribe members. Generally, individuals who attempt to assert dominance or establish a leadership position are ridiculed and ostracized. From what we can tell, these practices hold true for ancient hunter-gatherers as well.
