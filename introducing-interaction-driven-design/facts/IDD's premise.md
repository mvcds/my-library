#fact in [[0 - Introducing Interaction-Driven Design]]

[[Interaction-Driven Design|IDD]]'s [[premise]] is that an [[Software|Application]] should only exist to satisfy the [[Actor|Actors]]'s external needs[^1].

Each [[interaction]] between an actor and the app represents a need of the actor that has to be fulfilled by the app. IDD's [[Goal]] is to iteratively [[carreer/development/design/Design|Design]] and build [[Software|Applications]] that satisfy those needs
