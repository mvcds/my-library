#procedure about [[Exactly what words to say in specific scenarios]]

Some [[Word|Words]] can be used around uncertainty to make you look like a strong candidate. What you say depends on how sure you are about a subject

1. "I'm certain": show it off
2. "I'm not certain but I have an idea": use the buffer
3. "I have no clue": tell them so

The buffer is using phases like the following

- "I don't know, I'm definitely going to look that up right after this interview, but if I had to give my best guess I'd say... [x] and here is why [explanation/thought process]
- “I’m going to throw some things out there, but don’t hold me to them…”
- "I don't have experience with that yet but I've been reading [Thing you read] I would approach it like [Idea].”
- “ I don't have hands-on experience with this, but I have read about it and here’s what I know.”
- “This reminds me of this thing I built one time…”
- (This is best said with some charisma) “This is super interesting, tell me more about that.”
