[[Interviewing for SD|SDIs]] are a [[system-design-interview/concepts/Design|Design]] problem, but many developers approach it as if it was a [[Engineering]] problem instead.

[[Do mock interviews]] to prepare yourself by [[Antecipate questions|antecipating questions]], and during them [[Think like a tech lead]] but [[It's your responsibility to leave breadcrumbs for the interviewer to go where you want them to go but they still need to think they got you there|let they think they are guiding you]].  Remember that [[Measure success by how much you get the interviewer to say|The interviewers' goal is to find enough data to hire you]], so don't talk more than needed.

Know [[What interviewers are looking for, and what they are not looking for]] and that [[The interviewer will focus mostly on process, not the result]]. But that you should [[Present the tradeoffs and take some decisions based on it]] and [[Don't say brand names, but generic components instead]].

Keep in mind the following flags
- [[Do not just talk]]
- [[Honesty about lack of knowledge or gap in understanding]]
- [[Dismiss their steering]]
- [[Collaborate with the other]]
- [[Skip questions]]/[[Skip questions|Ignore Prompt]]
- [[Seniors drive the interview, juniors are driven]]
- [[Silence instead of asking for help]]
