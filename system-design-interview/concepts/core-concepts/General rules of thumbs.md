#concept in [[2 - 15 fundamental system design concepts]]

One of the [[Core Concepts for system design interviews]] states that there are some good rules of thumbs we should follow

- If an interviewer interrupts you, probably it's because you're going off track[^1], it's fine for them to ask stuff but it's a bad sign if they start telling you **how** to do it
- Prior experience affects how you [[system-design-interview/concepts/Design|Design]] the [[System]]
- [[Time]] management. Better to cover everything broadly than to explain in very small detail. The interviews has to finish trusting you can build an MVP out of the ground.
- Explaining why > explaining what. [[Present the tradeoffs and take some decisions based on it|Thinking about the tradeoffs if often more important that the final design]]
- Don't overcomplicate it. [[The first rule of distributed systems is that you should avoid them if you don't need them]]
- At some competence level, it becomes increasilly more necessary to up skill [[communication]]
