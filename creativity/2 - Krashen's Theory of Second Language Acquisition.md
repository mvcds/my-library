It has 5 different hypotheses (each one the fist bold word in the following snippets)

---

**Acquisition** and **learning** are different mental processes - acquisition is similar to what happens when your learning L1, learning is about formal instructions such as grammar rules

---

The **monitor** acts in a planning, editing, and correcting function when three specific conditions are met: that is,

1. the second language learner has sufficient time at his/her disposal
2. he/she focuses on the form or thinks about correctness
3. and he/she knows the rule

There are learners who use the 'monitor' all the time (over-users); those learners who have not learned or who prefer not to use their conscious knowledge (under-users); and those learners that use the 'monitor' appropriately (optimal users)

---

The **Input** hypothesis is only concerned with 'acquisition', not 'learning'. The learner improves and progresses when he/she receives second language 'input' that is one step beyond his/her current stage of linguistic competence and can understand it, even if (s)he can reproduce it - teachers should aim to give comprehensible Input' 

---

The **Natural Order** hypothesis says that each language has its own order necessary for `acquisition`. For a given language, some grammatical structures tend to be acquired early while others are late.

This order seemed to be independent of the learners' age, L1 background, and conditions of exposure. Krashen, however, points out that the implication of the natural order hypothesis is not that a language program syllabus should be based on the order found in the studies. In fact, he rejects grammatical sequencing when the goal is language acquisition.

---

the **Affective Filter** hypothesis embodies Krashen's view that a number of 'affective variables' play a facilitative, but non-causal, role in L2 acquisition.

These variables include:
- motivation
- self-confidence
- and anxiety
