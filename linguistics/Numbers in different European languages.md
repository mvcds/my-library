Why [[French]] keeps uses different number than most [[European Language|European Languages]]

- For most of [[History]], people didn't worry much about [[Number|Numbers]] - especially large ones, as most used to live in some form of scarcity
- In the past, people used their digits to count more frequently, and we have 20 of them. French were stubborn and kept it, for the numbers people used less often.
  - In situations involving professional handling of money they can use the "modern" variants. As they are faster and less error-prone situations.
- Compare "twenty-six", and the wrong "ten-six" (instead of "sixteen")

[[Danish]] uses [[Fraction|Fractions]]
