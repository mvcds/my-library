In this [[19 - Retrieval]] technique, instead of writing notes, write questions that will force you to [[Recall]] what you've learned.

Example, instead of writing “The Battle of Hastings took place in 1066,” write “When did the Battle of Hastings take place?” Every [[time]] you go over your notes, you’ll be forced to recall what you’ve learned.
