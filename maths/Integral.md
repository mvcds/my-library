![[derivative.png]]

Used to calculate the shape of things that do not fit the basic formulas (like circles or triangles)[^1]. It's used on [[Statistical graphics|graphs]].

$$\int_{lower}^{upper} F(x) * dx$$

(From lower limit to upper limit of the function which relates to x)

$\int$ and $dx$ work much like a parenthesis in equations, though they are not the same thing, this means that it's possible of having integral of integral. in this case you should remember that they'd work as parenthesis (but one3 case would en with $dx$ the other with $dy$, for instance)

Regarding the logic behind the formula, if we remember that $f(x) = y$ then it's easy to see that the more bars we have on the attached image, the more precise we can be on calculating the [[Statistical graphics|graph]]'s area.

The integral formula provides a "correction" for each bar in form of having the $dx$ attached to it, so in a way the formula can be read like this (sic) $y * d * x$ with $x * y$ being the are of one square in the graph +/- a correction for it.
