When there are many variables[^1] influencing the result

`y = a + b1 * x1 + bn * xn`

each x is an independent variable which influences the result

Some [[time]]s it's possible to "combine" similar x's in order to reduce the [[Complex|complexity]] but going towards the same goal e.g. "I like animals", "I care about animals" and "I don't like animal cruelty" could be used to represent the binary fact "like animals?"
