Determining the maximum rate at which [[maths/information-theory/Informational Entropy|Informational Entropy]] can be reliably transmitted over a communication channel - more than that and we risk errors.

Using [[Bit]] allows less entropy (tho other units can be used if adjusted) because 2 signals is the minimum necessary to convey discernable [[Information]].
