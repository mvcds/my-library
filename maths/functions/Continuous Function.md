A set of [[Data]] is said to be continuous if the [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|values]] belonging to the set can take on ANY [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|Value]] within a finite or infinite interval e.g. the height of a horse could be any value within the range of horse heights.

They usually require a measuring device 

**You can draw a continuous function without lifting your pencil from your paper.**
