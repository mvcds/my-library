A [[linguistics/Statement|linguistic statement]] that can either be [[Boolean|true or false]]

It's possible to combine statements by using:

- or: `a or b` means that at least one of the statements is[^1] true
- and: `a and b` means that all statement is[^1] true

With the ones above is possible to express some other statements, like:

- xor: `a xor b` means that only one statement is[^1] true (exclusive or)

[^1]: Or "need to be"
