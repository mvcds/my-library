A derivative is **the rate of change of one quantity with respect to another**.

In terms of [[Function]]s, this is defined by `dy/dx = f(x) = y'`, so the average speed formula is an example of a derivative.

The `'` after the function signalizes you're dealing with a derivative: `f'(x)`

Derivatives is commonly used to maximize or minimize a phenomenon e.g. number of sales.

To find a derivative, you need to apply some rules, take for instance `f(x) = [-x Ë† 2] + [4 * x] + [9] => y' = [- 2 * x ^ (2 - 1)] + [4] + [0]`

# Rules

- `f(x) = x => f'(x) = 1`
- `f(x) = c => f'(x) = 0`, c being any constant
- `f(x) = c * x => f'(x) = c`
- `f(x) = x ^ b => f'(x) = b * x ^ (b - 1)`, b being any arbitrary letter
- `f(x) = c * x ^ b => f'(x) = c * b * x ^ (b - 1)`
- `f(x) = y => f'(x) = y'`

In biology the size of a population at an instant is based on its born and mortality rate, as both rates are related but independent, they are derivatives of each other.
