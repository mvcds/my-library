A type of [[statistics]] dealing with [[Population vs Sample|samples]].

In [[Maths]] terms, estimator are [[Function]]s that take some parameters (what to estimate) to reach to a concrete result (the [[Estimate]])

Properties

- [[Bias]]: the expected value must be equal to the population parameter to it to be considered unbiased
- Efficiency: the less [[Variance]] the more efficient an estimator is

They are like judges, we want the **most efficient** and **less biased** estimator.

It's possible that a [[Variable]] to have many estimators
