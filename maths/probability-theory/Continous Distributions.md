A form of [[Distributions]] dealing with infinite [[maths/probability-theory/Event|outcomes]].[^1]

This means that we can assume that the [[Probability]] of an outcome is zero e.g. finishing a 100 miles race at exact 6 minutes is as likely as finishing at exact 6.7214532 minutes.

Types

- Normal: the bell-shaped [[Statistical graphics|graph]] is what normally happens in nature e.g. size is pretty much uniform. [[Outlier]]s are extremely rate. Normal distributions can be standardized to contains its values between 0 and 1. it requires a lot of data, otherwise outliers will pollute the result.
- Student's T: similar to normal one but clipped at the edges. Good to test [[Hypothesis]] with limited [[Data]]. This graph has a variable called "degrees of freedom"
- Chi-Squared: for hypothesis test and computing confidence intervals, and good to find goodness of fit
- Exponential: it accumulates things that reach plateau at some point e.g. a youtube live will have more viewers when it's being recorded, and as [[time]] goes by less and less viewers, so the curve of the [[Statistical graphics|graph]] gets into a boomerang shape
- Logistics: for continuous variable inputs affecting [[binary]] outcomes like doing a sport forecast
