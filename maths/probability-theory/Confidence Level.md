![[confidence-levels.png]]

**A [[Estimate|value]] that tell us how confident. we are regarding our interval** e.g. "I'm 95% confident that the [[Population vs Sample|population]] price will be within the [[Measures of central tendency|mean]] interval I got from my sample data" i.e. 95% of the cases will be within the interval.

It has an opposed variable called _alpha_ which is used to calculate the confidence

---

It's normal to use 90, 95 (most common) and 99 as a good confidence levels

---

The higher the confidence, the broader the interval (to accommodate more points, which allow [[Standard error|error]]).

In a bell shape, it mean that half of the [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|values]] we are not confident is to the right, and the other to the left. This implies that a 100% level is useless, as we're not able to predict anything.

A low (like 5%) is also useless because it narrows down too much.
