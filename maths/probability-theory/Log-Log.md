A [[Statistical graphics|graph]] that has its two axis in [[logarithm|logarithmic]] scales.

Monomials - relationships of the form $y = a * x ^ k$ - appear as straight lines in a log-log graph, with the power term (`k`) corresponding to the slope, and the constant term (`x`) corresponding to the intercept of the line.

Thus these graphs are very useful for recognizing these relationships and estimating parameters.

Any base cam be used for the logarithm, though most commonly base 10 (common logs) are used.
