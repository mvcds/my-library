A.K.A. ANOVA Framework

1. Sum of squares total
2. Sum of squares [[Linear Regression|regression]]
3. Sum of squares [[Standard error|error]]

Where 2 and 3 are opposites i.e. fewer errors equal to better regression

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a tool used to partition the observed [[variance]] in a particular variable into components attributable to different sources of variation.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) uses the same conceptual framework as linear regression. The main difference comes from the nature of the explanatory variables: instead of quantitative, here they are qualitative[^1].

$yi = β0 + ∑j=1...q βk(i,j),j + εi$

[^1]: What does the qualitative here means?
