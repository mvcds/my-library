One [[carreer/development/Variable|Variable]] does not influence the other - but it is still possible to infer some [[information]] from the [[Population vs Sample|sample]]

For instance, grades from different courses in the same university might have different numbers of students and not be taught by some teachers, it is still possible to calculate which teacher performs better (not only looking at the mean, as the number of students might be different this would cause a bias)

**This is used to "compare apples and oranges"** not only metaphorically e.g. two fancy shoe shops from the same market from the same brand - it's very unlikely a person will buy in one shop and in another in a given year, and we still can compare which one of them sells better for given parameters
