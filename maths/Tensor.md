An [[Algebraic structure]] which describes the relationship between algebraic objects in a set

A tensor has ranks

| Rank | Object            |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| 0    | [[maths/Scalar]]  |
| 1    | [[Vector]]        |
| 2    | n vs n [[Matrix]] |
| >=3  | Tensor            |

It can be thought as a multidimensional [[Array]]
