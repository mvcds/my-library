A course I took about [[Accessibility]] for [[World Wide Web|Web]] development by [[Axe Training]](?), tho they taught us the theory, it felt like most of the trainer's job was selling us the usage of their [[Axe Browser Extension]]

- Focus is important, instead of removing it try customising it
- A pattern to help [[Accessibility|A11y]] is to giving them an one-button process to go to the main content - visually, this can be activates only during tab
- Try reducing key-strokes
- Always show the focus
- Headings
- Tables with headers
- Forms properly labelled
- Lists need to be real
- Divs can be without text, if its styes has no semantic meaning, but some elements that do have it, like H2, cannot, unless they get an aria label on the wrapping semantic element - often a div, span or p
- Focus should care about dynamic components, if it steals the visual focus, focus should change
- Be as brief as possible but capture the creator's content when it comes to alternative text
- Not all images convey meaning, the alt can be empty
- An image (like a font icon) wrapped in an element like button might be insufficient to convey meaning, for those, aria-label can be used in the wrapper
- Any interactive component **must** have text creag(?), alt, or label
- Even tho protected(?) elements work on the browse, for [[Accessibility|A11y]] they are ignored
- Dynamic placement of images can cause bad contrast
- TH element have a scope attribute
- Everything we can interact with have to have an interactable name
- Grouping tags (like fieldsets) also need labels
- Radio buttons need groupings
- Aria is only used when we need to, so it takes precedence i.e. in case of labels vs `aria-labeledby`
- `aria-describedby` provides additional info about the form, it can be used for error, complement, or instruction
- form labels on top, rather than on side can be used on mobile
- When the screen reader interacts with something, say something
	- Focus on the error message in a submitted form
	- `aria-live` for a empty box that will contain an important message
