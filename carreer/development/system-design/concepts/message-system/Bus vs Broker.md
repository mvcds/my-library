I couldn't find consistent definitions separating [[Message Bus|Busses]] from [[Message Broker|Brokers]].

Some say a bus is a type of broker.

Others that a broker can perform action on the [[Message]] while the bus **just** forwards it.

And yet others that the bus centralizes the processing of the message before forwarding it.
