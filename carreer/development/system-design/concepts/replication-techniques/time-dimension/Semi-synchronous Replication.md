A [[Replication Synchronicity]] where one of the follower [[node|nodes]] is [[Synchronous Replication|synchronous]] and all the other [[Asynchronous Replication|asynchronous]], and when the synchronous fails, there's a [[Failover]], making another node synchronous

# Tradeoffs

Pros

- [[Data]] is at least in 2 different nodes

Cons

- Has to worry with failover
