The fundamental theorem of [[Software]] engineering (FTSE) is a [[term]] originated by [[Andrew Koenig]] to describe a remark by [[Butler Lampson]] attributed to the late [[David J. Wheeler]]

> We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection.

The theorem does not describe an actual theorem that can be proven; rather, it is a general principle for managing [[Complex|complexity]] through [[Abstraction]].
