Using a lot of resources, in this case, [[Processor]], to solve a problem.

We take a problem, breaks it down into a series of smaller steps, delivers instructions, and processors execute the solutions at the same [[time]].

It is also a form of programming that offers the same results as [[Concurrent Programming]] but in less time and with more efficiency

[[Declarative Concurrency]] is a good paradigm for [[Parallel Programming]] because its parts can be executed [[Concurrency|concurrently]] on different cores.

Funny enough, if you have [[Named State]] this becomes harder because [[State]] itself implies order (in the time dimension).

By connecting concurrent agents by [[stream|streams]], we can split them over the core to obtain a pipelined execution.
