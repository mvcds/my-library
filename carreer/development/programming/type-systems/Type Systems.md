A logical [[system]] comprising a set of rules that assigns a [[Property]] called a [[Type]] to the various constructs of a [[Computer]] program, such as variables, [[Expression]], [[Function]] or modules.

These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses in [[Code]].

The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for bugs in [[Computer]] programs by defining [[Interface]] between different parts of a [[Software]], and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way.
