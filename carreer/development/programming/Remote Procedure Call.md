A [[Communication Protocol]] where a [[Client]] can "simulate" that it's part of another [[network]] so it can execute [[Code]] (action/command) on a remote machine.

It's analogous to talk with close relationships: you don't need all the formal steps - in this case you don't need to know the network details.

# Tradeoffs
Good
- Space Efficient
- Development is easier

Bad
- Internal [[communication]] only
- [[Time|Timing]]/Communication issues
