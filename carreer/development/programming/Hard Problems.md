- There are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-1 errors.
- There are only two hard problems in [[distributed systems]]:  2. Exactly-once delivery 1. Guaranteed order of [[message]]s 2. Exactly-once delivery
- there's two hard problems in computer science: we only have one joke and it's not funny.
