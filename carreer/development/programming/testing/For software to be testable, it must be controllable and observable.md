> For [[software]] to be [[testability|testable]], it must be controllable and observable. [[Observability]] is the ability to measure the effects of a computation. [...] [[Controllability]] is the ability to reproduce all the contexts in which an object is to run, normal and abnormal. The new job of [[carreer/development/design/Design|Design]] is to make sure that software is controllable [[money|cheaply]] in both developer [[time]] and execution time.
