An #acronym for how [[Testing]] should be performed

- Fast: many hundreds of tests per second
- Isolated: [[Root Cause|[[success|failure]] reasons]] become obvious
- Repeatable: Present [[Determinism]] regardless of order and time
- Self-validating: [[Automate Everything]]
- [[Time]]ly: Practice [[Test-Driven Design]]
