There are some principles

1. Separate [[data]] from [[code]]
2. Model [[Entity|Entities]] with generic data structures (mostly [[Map]]s and [[Array]]s
3. Data is immutable
4. Data is comparable by value
5. Data has a literal representation

And concepts

- [[Abstraction]]
- [[Concretion]]
- [[carreer/development/programming/Identity|Identity]]
- [[Information]]
- [[Loose coupling]]
- Maybe: a propriety of the [[Aggregate]], not the field
- Names: **Names** are a fundamental property of information. However, in [[Static Type System|statically-typed]] languages, names compile away. There exist at compile [[time]] but not a run time. At run time, a field cannot be access **dynamically** by its name. In order to access data, we are required to import the definition of the class that contains the data.
- [[State]]
- [[Value]]
