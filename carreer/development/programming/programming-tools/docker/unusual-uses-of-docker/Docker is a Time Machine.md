One of the [[Unusual uses of Docker]]

Because the [[Registry]] is an append-only register for [[Programming Language|Programming Languages]], [[Operational System|OSs]] and your [[Software|Applications]], it's possible to use [[Docker]] to make sure that what you're developing has [[Backward Compability]].

All you have to do is to run/test your app against [[time|older]] targets and check if they work as expect.
