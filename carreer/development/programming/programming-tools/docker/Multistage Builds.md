Multistage builds use multiple FROM instructions. You can selectively copy files, called build artifacts, from one stage to another. You can leave behind anything you donâ€™t want in the final image.

Each FROM instruction

- begins a new stage of the build.
- leaves behind any [[State]] created in prior stages.
- can use a different base.

```
FROM golang:1.7.3 AS build
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/
RUN go get -d -v golang.org/x/net/html
COPY app.go .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o app .

FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
WORKDIR /root/
COPY --from=build /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/app .
CMD ["./app"]
```

Note that we name the first stage by appending a name to the FROM instruction to name. The named stage is then be referred to in the COPY --from= instruction later in the [[Dockerfile]].
