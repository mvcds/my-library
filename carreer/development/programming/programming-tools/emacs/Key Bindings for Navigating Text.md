Navigating text in [[Emacs]] can be done using the following commands

- `C-a` Move to beginning of line.
- `M-m` Move to first non-whitespace character on the line.
- `C-e` Move to end of line.
- `C-f` Move forward one character.
- `C-b` Move backward one character.
- `M-f` Move forward one word (I use this a lot).
- `M-b` Move backward one word (I use this a lot, too).
- `C-s` Regex search for text in current buffer and move to it. Press C-s again to move to next match.
- `C-r` Same as `C-s`, but search in reverse.
- `M-<` Move to beginning of buffer.
- `M->` Move to end of buffer.
- `M-g g` Go to line.
