You should use a [[Submodule]] for [[Component-based programming|Component-based development]], where the parent project only keeps references (links) to the components it refers to

And a [[Subtree]] for [[System-based programming|System-based development]] - it copies the other repo's whole history, unifying their [[Development Life Cycle]] from their point on
