A [[Infrastructure as Code|IaC]] [[tool]] for provisioning (building, changing, and versioning) [[infrastructure]] safely and efficiently through a defined [[workflow]]

It can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

By using [[Execution Plan]]s + [[Resource Graph]]s, Terraform has minimal human interaction.

- Day 1: when there was nothing as part of the tool
- Day 2+: where the infra evolves
