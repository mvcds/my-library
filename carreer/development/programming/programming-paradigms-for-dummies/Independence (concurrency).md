Constructing a program as independent parts.

Even making one instruction to be executed after the other already create a dependency based on [[time]][^1]

For [[Computer]], we can identify 3 levels of [[Concurrency]]

- [[Distributed System]]: each concurrent activity is called a [[Computer]] and they are connected through a [[Network]] - this is the base of the [[Internet]]
- Operating system: the [[software]] that manages a [[Computer]] uses processes as its concurrent activities. Each [[carreer/development/programming/Process|Process]] can run one application.
- Activities within a process: A concurrent activity is called a [[Thread]]. Each tab in a browser is a separate [[Thread]].
