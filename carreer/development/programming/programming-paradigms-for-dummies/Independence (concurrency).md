For [[Computer]], we can identity 3 levels of [[Concurrency]]

- [[Distributed System]]: each concurrent activity is called a [[Computer]] and they are connected through a [[Network]] - this is the base of the [[Internet]]
- Operating system: the software that manages a [[Computer]] uses processes as its concurrent activities. Each [[Process]] can run one application.
- Activities within a [[Process]]: A concurrent activity is called a [[Thread]]. Each tab in a browser is a separate [[Thread]].
