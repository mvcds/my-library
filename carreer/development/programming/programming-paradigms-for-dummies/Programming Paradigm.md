A way to tackle a programming problem based on [[Maths]] or a coherent set of principles/concepts. Java, C#, Python, JS and Ruby are virtually identical because they support the same paradigm ([[Object-Oriented Programming|OOP]])

Each paradigm is better suited for a kind of problem. They can be organized in a [[Paradigm Taxonomy]]

They influence the [[Design]] of the [[Programming Language]] due to the [[Kernel Language]] - see [[Language Design]]
