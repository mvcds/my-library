We say that an [[entity]] is polymorphic is it can take many forms.

In [[Programming]] this can be expressed by "attaching" [[Interface]]s to such an entity. This way an [[entity]] "can fit" in multiple [[Function]] calls.

Programmers can [[DRY]] up their code by dedicating a part of the codebase to handling the [[Interface]] rather than having N pieces of [[Code]] that do the same thing - this allows the [[Responsability Principle]] to take place
