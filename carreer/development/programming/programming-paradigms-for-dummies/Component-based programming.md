A style of [[Programming]] in which programs are organized as components, where each component may depend on other components.

A component is a building block that specifies part of a program. An instance of a component is called a module, which is a [[Record]] containing [[Lexically scoped closure|closures]].

A new module is created by a [[Function]] that takes its dependent modules as inputs. The component is the [[Function]].
