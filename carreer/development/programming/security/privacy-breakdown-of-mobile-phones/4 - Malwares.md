Malicious software on a mobile phone could read private [[data]] on the device (like stored text messages or photos). Malware can normally accomplish this by exploiting a security flaw, such as an outdated phone operating system.

It could also activate the [[3 - Phone Components and Sensors|device's sensors]] (such as microphone, camera, GPS) to find where the phone is or to monitor the environment, some malware is capable of turning the phone into a remote listening or surveillance device by covertly turning on the camera or microphone.

Governments themselves often forbid people, even government employees, from bringing personal cell phones into certain sensitive facilitiesâ€”mainly based on the concern that the phones could be infected with software to make them record conversations.

As we discussed above, precautions based on powering off phones could be noticed by a mobile operator; for example, if ten people all travel to the same building and then all switch off their phones at the same time, the mobile operator, or somebody examining its records, might conclude that those people were all at the same meeting and that the participants regarded it as sensitive. This would be harder to detect if the participants had instead left their phones at home or at the office.
