Diverse components can be used to extract some form or another of user's data

- GPS: though the sattelites don't know your individual position, apps can get to know them
- NFC: it needs to be **really** close to work but if an app knows you read from NFC, it can know where that reading was made e.g. a cashier in a market
- Biometrict Sensors: phone-wise those are okay, the problem is law enforcement-kind of situations
- Motion Sensors: as applications often read sensor information that can potentially identify your device, even though the potential to be detected with these methods is minimal[^1]
