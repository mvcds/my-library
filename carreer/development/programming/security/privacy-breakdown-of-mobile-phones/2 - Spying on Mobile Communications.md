When mobiles begin to operate, secutiry was not a design concern.

Later, when it became, different providers start placing some protocols to prevent people spying on calls and/or texts but as the governments were not very interested in enforcing high-end encription, those laws were vague and full of breeches.

For instance, nothing makes providers need to update their protocols regularly or even turn them on.

So a good way to protect yourself is just to assume security is failing and look for your own ways to encrypt your communications like by using a message app that does so.
