It's virtually impossible to stop your phone of being localized

There are 4 main ways of getting tracked:

1. Mobile Signal Tracking from Towers
2. Mobile Signal Tracking from Cell Site Simulators
3. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Tracking
4. Location Information Leaks from Apps and Web Browsing

Location tracking is not always about where you are **right now** but also about your historical locations, making easy to extrapolate your values, believes and activities (like personal encounters).

# Mobile Signal Tracking from Towers

The first one uses the towers to triangulate your signal, this is done with [[Angle of Arrival]] measurements wich gives your location with 1KM of precision. And thought normally only mobile companies have access to those, governments can lawfully or forcefully get their hands on this data.

It's important to know that signal tracking can be individidual or "grupal", a so called "dump", where all the signals from a given area can be tracked down to some activity, for instance, the goverment looking for people who went to a protest in certain park.

# Mobile Signal Tracking from Cell Site Simulators

Technically sofisticated organizations can also pretend to be real towers, so they can read the [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]] by using IMSI-catchers (AKA Stringrays)

# Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Tracking

Those are lower-frequencies radio waves and can be "listen to" by using the correct aparatus.

If the target device always sends its MAC address, then it is pretty easier for people to spy on it.

# Location Information Leaks from Apps and Web Browsing

Modern phones come with a "Location Services" feature that can allow apps/pages to access some information about the location of the user.
