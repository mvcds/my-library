A gamified approach for analysing [[Open Web Application Security Project]]-identified [[Threat|Threats]] developed by [[Open Web Application Security Project|OWASP]]

Each card has: - A suite of the following categories - [[Data]] validation and [[Encoding]] - [[Authentication]] - Session management - [[Authorization]] - [[Cryptography]] - Cornucopia - A numerical rank that indicates average risk, it might be different in every case - References for the threat - Threat details to help understanding the the risks
