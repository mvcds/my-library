You draw a diagram representing a [[Tree]] for each [[Threat]].

With the root node being the attacker's [[Goal]], and each possible way of achieving that goal, being a node which ramifies according to the action they can take. Then you start asking how to [[Mitigation Strategy|mitigate]] an arbitrary [[Node Leaf]].

Guidelines:
- Keep asking "[[Five whys|why]]" 
- Do not list hacking techniques: as there are many ways of doing the same thing, if we get attach to some techniques we known, we might not think about those alternative ways
- Ask the "hows"
- Group the attacks into a common goal
