 This rhetoric twists the debates about [[Privacy]] towards a direction which neglects the **social value** of privacy.
 
 It should not be weighed as an individual right against the greater social good but instead, viewed as a societal dimension valued in terms of the social role it plays: if safeguard individuals from abuses by those in power.
 
 For instance, privacy allows true free speach, free association and varios other rights which are essencial for [[democracy]]. Being that free speach ans association can lead to the generation of innovative ideas and contribute a lot to the development of societies.
 
 That is, giving up privacy (as a fundamental human right) is said to improve society but how can society at large benefit from that when there is so much at risk?
