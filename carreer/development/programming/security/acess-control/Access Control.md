It's like going to the airport

1. [[Authentication]]: they ask your IDs
2. [[Authorization]]: they ask your boarding pass
3. [[Asset|Resource]] access: you can fly

Some other authorization policies include but are not limited to

- Mandatory access control (MAC): centrally-managed non-overridable policy based on subject and resource security attributes, such as Linux' LSM
- Relationship-based Access Control (ReBAC): policy that is largely determined by relationship between principals and resources
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC): policy approach that includes owner-managed permission control, as well as systems with transferable tokens of authority
- Rule-based Access Control: dynamic role or permission assignment based on a set of operator-programmed rules
