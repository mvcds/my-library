aliases: [[Whitelisting, forbiddenlisting, Blacklisting]]
---

An allowedlisting tells which [[user]]s are [[Authorization|authorized]] to access some resource. Whereas a forbiddenlisting is its opposite.

Allowing known people to access something is more [[Information Security|Secure]] than forbidden everybody else because you're never sure who is really "safe".

Whitelising is a more common name than [[Allowedlisting]] but due to racism of the opposite term (blacklisitng) we avoid using it.
