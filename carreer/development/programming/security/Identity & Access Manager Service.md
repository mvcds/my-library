aliases: [IAM Service, IAM]
---

A kind of [[Security Token Service]] responsible for managing [[carreer/development/programming/security/Identity|identities]].

You should not implement it yourself because it's a huge and sensitive topic. So, always use a third-party that complies to standard implementations such as [[OAuth]], [[JSON Web Token|JWT]] and [[OpenID Connect]]

When using an IAM platform, you gonna have 3 capabilities.

- [[Authentication]]
- [[Identity Management]]
- [[Security Token management]]

It has some overlapping with [[API Gateway]]
