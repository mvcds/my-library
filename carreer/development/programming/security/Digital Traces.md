Not all digital traces are important and no, maybe what you eat for breakfast doesn't matter.

But when you look carefully at the digital traces you create, you'll find a mix: some might be very banal (your breakfast), but others might be much more personal - where you go (which can also show [[1 - Location Tracking|what you're doing]], and with whom), or what your health concerns are. Think about what you share with Google just through searches alone - these might be things you haven't even shared with your partner or your closest friends.  
  
The question is, can you really always tell the difference between the digital traces that would be better to keep private, and those that don't matter? What seems banal [[time|today]] might be important tomorrow, or might be interesting for someone else, or might give away a lot more [[information]] about you than you think.
