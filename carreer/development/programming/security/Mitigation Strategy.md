The mitigation [[strategy]] is [[context|contextual]], it depends on the risk appetite of the [[business]] for each [[Threat]].

Some of the strategies are:

- Accept Risk: the [[Return of Investiment|ROI]] of doing anything at this point is negative, the best response is to accept it and [[Monitoring|Monitor]] it instead
- Avoid Risk: when the impact is so big that it's better to terminate the risk by eliminating the associated [[Asset]] all together
- Transfer Risk: shift the impact and management of the risk to someone else e.g. using a payment service to deal with money in your system is covered by contractural agreements
- Mitigate the Risk: the ROI of implementing countermeasures is attractive, so we should act on it
