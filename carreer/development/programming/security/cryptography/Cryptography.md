Cryptography is a method of [[Information Security|protecting information]] and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the [[information]] is intended can read and process it. The prefix "crypt-" means "hidden" or "vault" -- and the suffix "-graphy" stands for "[[Writing]]."

[[Software]]-wise, it's done through [[Algorithm|Algorithms]] that exchange some sets of keys ([[Private Key]] and/or [[Public Key]]).
