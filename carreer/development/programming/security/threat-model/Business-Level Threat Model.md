The first step of a [[Threat Model]] is to prioritize the threats/risk against your [[business]]

During this step, it's useful to keep in mind:
- The [[Information Security|CIA Triad]]
- The business workflows
	- The [[Entity|Entities]] that perform them and their [[Actors and Roles|Roles]]
	- How they interact

Those can be used to come up with [[Threat|Threats]] which should then be prioritized.
