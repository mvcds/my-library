You can classify [[Threat|Threats]] in 3 categories, based on the countermeasures:

- Non-[[Mitigation Strategy|mitigated]]: when you've not identified any countermeasure
- Partially mitigated: when you put a few countermeasures to limit the impact of the vulnerabilities
- Fully mitigated: when you put enough countermeasures to bring the impact close to zero
