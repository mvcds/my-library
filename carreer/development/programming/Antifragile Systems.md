Antifragility is a property of [[system]]s that increase in capability to thrive as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or [[success|failures]]

> Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.

# Instructions

- **Stick to simple rules**: we must resist the temptation to respond complexity with complexity
- **Decentralize**: centralized units become more [[Abstraction|abstract]] and theoretical in order to be broadly applicable, decentralized units are adverse impacts (from randomness) are contained and other units can learn from them
- **Layered Systems**: the antifragility of a system comes from the fragility of its components
- **Build redundancy & overcompensation**: a key component of antifragility, as overcompensation builds opportunistic response to unanticipated random events
- **Do not suppress randomness**:

- **Everyone must have skin in the game**: participants must face the consequences of their actions and endure [[success|failures]] as well as enjoy [[success]]
- **Practioners > Theoricians**: "we don't put theories into practice, we create theories out of practice". We often reverse the real world flow of knowledge building
