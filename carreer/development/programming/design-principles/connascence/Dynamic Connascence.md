[[Connascence]] dependent on the [[execution patterns]] during [[Runtime]]

- **Connascence of Execution** (order) (CoE): this is when the order of execution of multiple components is important
- **Connascence of Timing** (CoTm): this occurs when the [[time|timing]] of the execution of multiple components is important.
- **Connascence of Value** (CoV): this occurs when there are constraints on the possible [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|Value]] some shared elements can take. It's usually related to invariants.
- **Connascence of [[my-library/carreer/development/programming/Identity|Identity]]** (CoI): this happens when multiple components must reference the entity.
