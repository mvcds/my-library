A set of guidelines for assigning responsibility to classes and objects in [[Object-Oriented Programming|OOP]]

# Patterns

- [[Information]] expert: used to decide which [[Class]] is the more relevant to hold some [[Information]]
- Creator
- Controller: using a non-[[UI]] [[Interface]] [[Object]] to receive or handle (external) events
- Indirection: using an [[Object]]
- [[Low-Coupling]]
- [[High-Cohesion]]
- [[Polymorphism]]
- Protected variations: wrap unstable [[Code]] with an [[Interface]], and have stable code around it
- Pure fabrication: a [[Class]] that does not represent a concept in the problem domain, specially made up to achieve one or more of the points about. This kind of class is called a "service" in [[Domain-Driven Design]]
