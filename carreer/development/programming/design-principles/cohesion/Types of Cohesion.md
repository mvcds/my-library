Types of [[Cohesion]], from best to worse:

1. Functional: two elenents of a [[Module]] coperate to execute a single [[Function]]
2. Sequential: one element [[Function Pipeline|Pipelines]] its output to another
3. Communicational: all tasks of the module work on the same [[Data Structure]]
4. Procedural: all parts of the module contribute to the sequence
5. Temporal: when all parts of the module needs to be executed in [[Parallelism|parallel]]
6. Logical: all parts parts execute a similar operation
7. Coincidental: the parts of the module loosely associated with, if at all
