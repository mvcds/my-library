The "D" in [[SOLID Principles]]

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. [[Interface]]).
- [[carreer/development/programming/Abstraction|Abstractions]] should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on [[carreer/development/programming/Abstraction|Abstractions]].
