This is important because, With multiple [[carreer/development/programming/Process|processes in the same [[Container]], it is harder to troubleshoot the container because logs from different processes will be mixed together, and it is harder to manage the processes lifecycle, for example, to take care of “zombie” processes when their parent process dies.

Second, using several containers for an application is simpler, more transparent, and enables [[Coupling|decoupling]] [[software]] dependencies. Also, more granular containers can be reused between [[team|teams]].
