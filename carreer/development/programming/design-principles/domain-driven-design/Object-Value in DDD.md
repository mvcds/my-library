Contrary to an [[Entity]], an [[Object]]-[[my-library/carreer/development/Value|Value]] does not have an [[carreer/development/programming/security/identity/Identity#Noun|identity]] by its own, so to make one apart from another, we have to consider all of its properties at once.

If one property differs, they are not the same object.

On the other hand, if they are all the same, we might consider both objects as the same - replacing one by another would make no difference.
