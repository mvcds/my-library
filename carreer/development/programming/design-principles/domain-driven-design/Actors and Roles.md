aliases: [Actor, Actors, Role, Roles]

- Actors (people[^1]): they might accomplish tasks in different roles[^2]
- Roles (tasks): roles are the actual thing that we should name [[Entity in DDD|entities]] after

[^1]: Or [[System|Systems]]

[^2]: There might be obvious actors, or subtle ones, for instance, in an application, the software development [[team]] is also an actor - their relevance as an actor might depend on context
