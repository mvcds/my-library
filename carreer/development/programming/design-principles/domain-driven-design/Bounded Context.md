A perspective of the [[Domain]] where a [[Model]] have limited and focus meaning for given context.

Its boundaries allow the same objects to be represented differently according to the context, for instance, an [[Entity]] in one bounded context might be a [[Object-Value in DDD]] in another.

Such boundaries should be as explicitly as separated repositories, schemas, etc.

The "namespaces" of a bounded context are known as [[Module in DDD|module]]

The objects in a bounded context are expected to have either

- Communical [[cohesion]]
- Functional cohesion

People working in a context have a set of **[[Actors and Roles|responsibilities]]** which need to be translated into the software
