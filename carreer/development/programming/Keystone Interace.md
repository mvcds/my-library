aliases: [Keystone Interaces]
---

A development technique where we develop the visual [[Interface]] last, with all possible tests and integrations on the back-end normally.

When putting the keystone, we can do it through [[Feature Toggle|Featue Toggles]] to minimize any other impact that doing so might happen: for instance, the ends might not integrate well.

This is different from [[Dark Launching]] because the [[User]] isn't even able to use the back-end until the interface is finished.
