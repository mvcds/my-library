Both [[Command]]s and [[carreer/development/programming/Event]]s are [[Message]]s but they differ on intent.

> In an [[Event-Driven Architecture]] architecture, there can be no question that an [[carreer/development/programming/Event]] raised represents something that has happened.
>  Now, because Commands are something we want to happen, and Events are something that has happened, **we should be using different verbs when we name these things. This drives separate representations**.
