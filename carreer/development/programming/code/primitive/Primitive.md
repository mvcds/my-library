Some [[Programming Language]] come with pre-defined [[data type]]s which other, custom types can derive from.

We call those types "primitives".

Choosing the correct primitive is important not only to shape your data, but also to write efficient [[Software]], as some types might have variations - each taking different amount of [[Bit]]s from your [[Memory]]

Some common ones

- [[Boolean]]
- [[Char]]
- [[Number]]
- [[String]]

A direct [[Value]], as opposed to a reference to something that contains the real [[Value]]
