A [[data type]] for numerical representation - so we can do [[Maths|mathematical]] operations.

Different [[Programming Language]]s have different number formats, the most common being some sort of [[Integer]]s (whole numbers) and  [[Float]]s (decimal). 

That is, numbers come in different formats so you can choose the most efficient for your [[Memory]] when necessary.
