Just a way to express [[Function]]s in a formal setting using [[Pure Function]]s

---

Lambda calculus (also written as Î»-calculus) is a formal [[System]] in [[Maths|mathematical]] logic for expressing computation based on [[Function]] [[Abstraction]] and application using variable binding and substitution.

It is a universal [[Model]] of computation that can be used to simulate any [[Turing Machine]].

They can encode every computation, the basis for [[Functional Programming]] and are present in most [[Programming Language]]
