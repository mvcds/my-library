aliases: [ARIA]
---

A set of roles and attributes that suplement [[HyperText Markup Language|HTML]] to make the [[World Wide Web|Web]] more [[Accessibility|accessible]. 

Keep in mind that no ARIA is better than bad ARIA because otherwise the page might become misleading.

[The first rule of ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1):

> If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so.
