aliases: [Sessions]

Because the [[HTTP]] protocol does not have a way to relate [[user]] [[data]] across requests due to its [[State|stateless]] nature, it's necessary to do it through some management.

A session can be for [[Authentication|authenticated]] or anonymous users, regardless if their are human or [[Server|Services]]

Normally [[Cookie|Cookies]] are used to manage sessions

Sessions are a attractive target for breaching [[Information Security|Security]][^1]
