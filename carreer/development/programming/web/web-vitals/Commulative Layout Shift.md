![[CLS.jpg]][^1]

A [[Web Vitals|Web Vital Metric]] about keeping [[Layout]] steady during loading, to prevent [[User|Users]] click in different things that they didn't want due to layout changes

To mitigate it we can mark images with `preload` and also using things as setting height and weights, or use a "pre-image"

Good < 0.1
Poor > 0.25

[^1]: The user was about to click on "no, go back" when the "protip" banner changed the layout, causing the user to click on the "submit" buttons instead
