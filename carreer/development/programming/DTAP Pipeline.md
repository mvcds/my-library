When [[deploy]]ing a [[Software]] goes to a bunch of different [[environment]]s before hitting production

- Development
- [[Testing]]
- Acceptance
- Production

The environments between dev and prod might vary a [[Bit]] but the logic is the same: [[artifact]]s moving through environments for a some people/[[team|teams]] to allow it going to the next one, causing a "beneficial delay"

Part of the [[Agile]] community thinks that DTAP slows putting [[Code]] into production, and thus should be avoided through techniques like [[Feature Toggle]]s and [[blue-green deployment]].
