Anything our code does **besides** resolving to a value[^1]

Examples
-   network calls;
-   reading and writing files;
-   [[database]] queries;
-   modifying DOM elements;
-   mutating global variables;
-   even writing to the console.

Normally, it changes the "outside world" besides the code

[^1]: Resolving to a value is considered an [[Expression]]
