When measuring the load, performance, cost or something else of a new [[feature]], or from a possible variation of this feature it is possible to do it without without [[User]]s being aware of it.[^1]

For helping with this, it is possible, and recommended, to use [[Feature Toggle|Feature Toggles]].

This is different from [[Keystone Interace|Keystorne Interfaces]] because the user indeeds use what is on the back-end.
