aliases: [Columnar Databases, Column-Oriented Database]
---
A kind of [[NoSQL Database]][^1] where [[data]] is stored by columns rather than rows

By storing data in columns rather than rows, the [[Database]] can more precisely access the data it needs to answer a query rather than scanning and discarding unwanted data in rows

[Ë†1]: Event though it is a [[Relational Database]], it often does not implement [[Structured Query Language|SQL]], making it part of the "not only SQL"
