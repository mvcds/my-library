aliases: [Extensible Record Store]
---

A kind of [[NoSQL Database|NoSQL Database]] which is similar to [[Relational Database]] with the difference being that names and formats of columns vary from row to row on the same table

A wide-column store can be interpreted as a two-dimensional [[Key-Value Database]] and differs from [[Columnar Database]] because their columns do not get stored separately on disk.

[Ë†1]: Event though it is a [[Relational Database]], it often does not implement [[Structured Query Language|SQL]], making it part of the "not only SQL"
