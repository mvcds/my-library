aliases: [Extensible Record Store]
---

A kind of [[NoSQL|NoSQL Database]] which is similar to [[Relational Database]] with the difference being that names and formats of columns vary from row to row on the same table

A wide-column store can be interpreted as a two-dimensional [[Key-Value Store]] and differs from [[Columnar Database]] because their columns do not get stored separately on disk.
