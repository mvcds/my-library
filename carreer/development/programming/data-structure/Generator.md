A routine that can be used to control the iteration behavior of a loop. All generators are also [[iterator]].

It yields the [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|Values]] one at a [[time]], which requires less memory and allows the caller to get started processing the first few values immediately. In short, a generator looks like a [[function]] but behaves like an iterator.
