aliases: [Streams]
---

An [[data structure]] to process a sequence of [[data]] elements made available over [[time]]. A stream can be thought of as items on a conveyor belt being processed one at a time rather than in large batches.

Streams are processed differently from batch data â€“ normal functions cannot operate on streams as a whole, as they have potentially unlimited data, and formally, streams are [[Coinduction|codata]] (potentially unlimited), not data (which is finite).
