A property of [[System|Systems]] that increase in capability to thrive as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, [[Fault|Faults]], attacks, or [[success|failures]]

> Antifragility is beyond [[resiliency|resilience]] or [[robustness]]. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.
