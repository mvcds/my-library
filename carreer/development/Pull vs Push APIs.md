A pull API waits until a consumer asks for the next value. A good example in [[Javascript]] is an Iterable, such as the [[object]] produced by a [[generator function]]

A push API enumerates over the source values and pushes them through the tubes as fast as it can. A call to [[array]].[[Reducer|reduce]] is a good example of a push API

- Pull: lazy evaluation
- Push: eager evaluation
