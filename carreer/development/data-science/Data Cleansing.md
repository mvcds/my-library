The first thing to do with [[data]] is to clean it, the cleaning should be represented somehow e.g. a field on the entry or a different file all together.

Alternatively, it's also possible to mark data as incomplete or invalid (if you cannot clean it).

If you're removing less than 5% of the observations, you are free to just remove all that have missing [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|values]].
