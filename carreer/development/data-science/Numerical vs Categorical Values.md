In [[Data Science]] there's a distinction between [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|values]] that can be manipulated to bring [[my-library/philosofy/Value|Value]] (Numerical) from ones that do not bring value (Categorical).

Thus if an id is a [[number]], it is considered a categorical value rather than a numerical value because summing ids up doesn't make sense.
