aliases: [Architecture Decision Records, ADR, ADRs]
---

An in-[[Version Control System|VCS]] short document that captures significant [[Software Architecture|Architectural]] decisions. 

Its title should start by a number and a concise title for the decision. The number guarantees that ADRs are kept in order.

Other items of those documents are:

- Title
- Date
- Status
- Context[^1]
- Decision[^1]
- Consequences[^1]

[^1]: If the ADR originates from an [[Request for Comments|RFC]], those topics can be summarized in the ADR and a link to the RFC can be added, so to avoid redundancy
