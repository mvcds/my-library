A sequence of [[Information]] that attaches a [[time]] period to each [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|Value]].

The value can be pretty much anything measurable that depends on time in some way, like prices, humidity, or a number of people. As long as the [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|values]] we record are unambiguous, any medium could be measured with time series.
