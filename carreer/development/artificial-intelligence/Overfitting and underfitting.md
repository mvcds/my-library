- Underfitting: The [[Model]] has not captured the underlying logic of the [[Data]]
- Overfitting: Our training has focused on the particular training set so much that it has "missed the point". It normally captures the data but not how they relate (noise interferes with relationships), so it will not perform well on different [[Dataset|Datasets]]
