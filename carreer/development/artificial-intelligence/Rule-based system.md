Given some information (assertion) the [[system]] is able to infer other [[information]] using the know rules.

Eg: if a priest can only by summoned by a temple, and there's a priest, we can be sure that a temple has existed; At the same [[time]], if a temple exists, it's possible that one or more priests also exist]

# Components

- Working Memory ([[State]]): stores know facts and assertions made by the rules
- Rules Memory: if-then rules operating over the working memory

# Inference Algorithms

- Forward Chaining
- Backward Chaining
