When the [[Machine Learning|learning]] is supervised, it means that the [[Model]] is given inputs and its expected outputs and it comes up with the logic

- Classification: creates new categories
- Regression: finds numbers

When the learning is unsupervised, the model does some [[Clustering]] from which humans can extract labels later
