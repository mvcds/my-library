Traditionally, humans "tell" the machine what to do through algorithms, with ML we invert this by giving the machine only a goal and teaching it about the trial-and-error process in a [[Maths|mathematical]] sense

Eventually the machine gets into results that are more and more accurate[^1], and then we can check if it really worked by giving a untrained dateset
