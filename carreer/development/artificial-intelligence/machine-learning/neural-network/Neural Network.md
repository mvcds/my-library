Kind of a [[Maths|mathematical]] [[function]] approximator which returns a unique set if output for a given input.

Inputs to the network are independent variables, while the output represents the dependent variables.

# Advantages over other [[Artificial Intelligence]] techniques

- Relegates key decision-making process to trained networks, instead of coding complex [[Finite State Machine]] or [[Rule-based system]]
- They adapt as their [[environment]] changes

# Disadvantages

- Computationally expensive
- Prone to producing utter garbage based due to poor tuning[^1]
- And generally difficult to interpret (they’re “black boxes”)[^2]
