(w and u are [[Weight|weights]])

An [[Algorithm|Algo]] for [[Neural Network]]s using [[Optimization function|gradient descent]]. 

It consists of calculating the contribution of each [[Parameters vs Hyperparameters in Neural Networks|parameter]] to the [[Standard error|error]]. We backpropagate the errors through the net and update the parameters (weights and [[Bias|Biases]]) accordingly.

Due to its [[Maths]], it's the essence of the optimization process
