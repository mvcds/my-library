![[initialization.png]]

A very important process for [[Backpropagation (of errors)|Backpropagation]] where we set the initial [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|values]] of the [[weight|weights]]. 

Different initialized numbers give us better backpropagation because that if they were equal, the outputs wouldn't be able to know which weights are more relevant
