In category classification[^1], a prior is how much % a given category is known to be in a [[dataset]]. e.g. `80% cats and 20% dogs`.

For inputs in [[Machine Learning]], always use balanced priors by selecting random [[Population vs Sample|samples]] to remove from the large group.

If they are unbalanced the ML might learn that there is a favorite way of classifying stuff and start only classifying everything as such
