In [[artificial intelligence]] and operations research, constraint satisfaction is the process of finding a solution to a set of constraints that impose conditions that the variables must satisfy

A solution is therefore a set of [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|values]] for the variables that satisfies all constraints[^1] â€” that is, a point in the feasible region.
