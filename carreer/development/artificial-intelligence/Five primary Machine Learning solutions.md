- Recommender/ranking systems provide a ranked list of documents from a corpus. These documents can be anything from apps in the app store to movies on Netflix.
- [[Event]]/action prediction models predict the likelihood of an event or user action. At Google, [[machine learning]] is used to predict a click (e.g., showing you videos that you're likely to click).
- Classification [[model]]s classify arbitrary [[object]]s into known classes, like categorizing emails as spam or not spam.
- Generative models generate output in a form similar to the input they were trained with, like translation models that turn text in one [[language]] into text in another language.
- [[Clustering]] is a form of unsupervised machine learning in which similar objects are “clustered” together, like segmenting users into groups.
