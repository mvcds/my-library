A type of [[Standard error|error]] in which certain elements of a dataset are more heavily weighted and/or represented than others.

A **biased** dataset does not accurately represent a model's use case, resulting in [[Skewness|skewed]] [[maths/probability-theory/Event|outcomes]], low accuracy levels, and analytical errors

In [[Machine Learning|ML]] there are as many biases as there are outputs

Under the [[Linear Model]] context
