An [[Algorithm]] that finds the shortest path by guiding the search with a heuristic function: actual distance traveled plus estimated remaining distance to [[Goal]]. The estimation must not be greater than the actual remaining distance

It will always find the fastest way to go from point A to B, using some kind of [[heuristic]] which can be anything the [[model]] may have/use (resources, distance, speed, etc)

# Possible heuristics

- Distance
- Terrains Cost
- Influential Map
