It's possible to "trick" the observer of a [[pathfinding]] system by allowing something to leave behind a breadcrumb trail which is followed by the [[Artificial Intelligence]].

If the trail goes more than once for the same spot, it's possible to use the most recent as a shortcut to the [[goal]].

Often players themselves leave the breadcrumbs.
