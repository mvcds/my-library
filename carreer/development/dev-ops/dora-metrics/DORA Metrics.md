A result of six years’ worth of surveys conducted by the DORA ([DevOps Research and Assessments](https://devops-research.com/))

- Quality (as seem by me)
	- **[[Deployment Frequency]]**
	- **[[Mean Lead Time for Changes]]**
- Stability (as seem by me)
	- **[[Mean Time to Recover]]**
	- **[[Change Failure Rate]]**

These metrics serve as a guide to how well the engineering teams are performing and how successful a company is at DevOps, ranging from “low performers” to “elite performers.

They help DevOps and engineering leaders measure software delivery throughput (**velocity**) and stability (**quality**)

#complement specify the metrics (in their own files)?

To improve in all 4 metrics, key is to embed [[quality]] into the [[development lifecycle]], otherwise you [[deploy]] fast and the lead time is short, but you fail a lot and at the end, that’s worst (less happy customers).
