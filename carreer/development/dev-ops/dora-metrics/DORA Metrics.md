aliases: [DORA Metric, DORA]

A result of six years’ worth of surveys conducted by the [DevOps Research and Assessments](https://devops-research.com/) [DORA]

- [[Quality]] (as seem by me)
	- **[[Deployment Frequency]]**
	- **[[Mean Lead Time for Changes]]**
- [[Stability]] (as seem by me)
	- **[[Mean Time to Recover]]**
	- **[[Change Failure Rate]]**

These [[carreer/development/data-science/Metric|Metric]] serve as a guide to how well the engineering [[team|teams]] are performing and how successful a company is at [[DevOps]], ranging from “low performers” to “elite performers.

They help DevOps and engineering leaders measure software delivery throughput (**velocity**) and stability (**quality**)

#complement specify the metrics (in their own files)?

To improve in all 4 metrics, key is to embed quality into the [[development lifecycle]], otherwise you [[deploy]] fast and the lead time is short, but you fail a lot and at the end, that’s worst (less [[happiness|happy]] [[Customer|customers]]).
