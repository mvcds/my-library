The [[code]] or binaries that [[Ansible]] copies to and executes on each [[Ansible Managed Node|Managed Node]] (when needed) to accomplish the action defined in each [[Ansible Task|Task]]. Each module has a particular use, from administering users on a specific type of database to managing VLAN interfaces on a specific type of network device. You can invoke a single module with a task, or invoke several different modules in a playbook. Ansible modules are grouped in collections.
