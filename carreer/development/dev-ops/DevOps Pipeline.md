An [[Automate Everything|automated]] [[carreer/development/programming/Process#Noun|process]] through which [[Software]] is gets a normalized development-to-production treatment.

It includes:

- [[Continous Integration]]
- [[Continous Delivery]]
- [[Continous Deployment]]

---

It's analogous to a [[Function Pipeline]] where the [[Input]] is the topmost [[Git Commit|Commit]] and the [[Output]] is workable [[Software]].

For its processes we can apply many things, from [[Testing]] to [[Information Security|Security]] checks, and many more.
