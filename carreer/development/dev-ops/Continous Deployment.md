AKA CD

The ability to keep making [[Deploy]]s to an environment, as a consequence of [[Continous Integration]]

It's necessary to emphasize that CD is not always desirable, as some situations might require some gate keeping (like [[Testing]] or business approval).

And in another situations this can happen transparently i.e. without user noticing, for instance by using [[Feature Toggle]] to control if the change is pourposelly perceptible or not.
