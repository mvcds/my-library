A [[Cross-Functional Requirement]]
 
We say that a [[system]] is modular if we can understand and update a [[Component]] without changing the rest of it.

Modularity allows us to create smaller systems that are less [[Complex]], more [[Maintainability|maintanable]] and more [[Reusability|reusable]], presenting [[High-Cohesion]] and [[Low-Coupling]] between subparts of differnt modules

According to [[Programming Paradigms for Dummies - What Every Programmer Should Know|programming paradigms for dummies]], for modularity, [[Named State]] might be a precious tool.
