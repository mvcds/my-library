It's about [[carreer/development/design/Design|designing]] how multiple (logical) components in a  [[system]] get assembled (rather than how they are created).

The earlier an architectural decision is made, the more weight it has on impacting future design and architectural choices.

# Why is architecture important?

- Enables desired  [[Cross-Functional Requirement|Cross-Functional Requirements]][^2]
- Helps considering stakeholders' needs and/or expectations[^1]
- Restricts design choices, enabling creativity in another areas.

[^1]: It might even be the case that the architecture will mimic the organization's structure
[^2]: Because not all of them are compatible, you end up having to pick up and prioritize the ones that are most adequate for you, taking into consideration all the software already in place that partially takes in care of some of them e.g. security can be delegated to an internal framework
