aliases: [Monolithic Application]
---

A kind of [[Software Architecture]] where you are actually just going with the flow, without thinking how you're arranging the components.

Normally this is how projects start for later refactoring.

---

It means that only one executable (even when composed by multiple distinct parts) gets created, and thus deployed

This architecture does not allow us to mix technologies and often make harder for different parts of the code base to grow independently

This is not a synonymous for a bad application!
