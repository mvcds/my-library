A kind of [[Software Architecture]] where you have multiple independent services (machine, code and data) which communicate only trough some protocol over the [[Network]], like HTTP.

A possible "evolution" of [[Layered Architecture]], after the need of independent development and/or deployment of parts of the [[system]].
