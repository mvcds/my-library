aliases: [SOA]

A kind of [[Software Architecture]]

Composed by many services, each concerning a business activity. A service can be composed by other services.

Normally contracts between services need a formal way of standard, and services rely on a Enterprise [[Message Bus|Service Bus]] where normally the application logic happens between services.

SOA sometimes bumps into people having to have long meetings about defining contracts that work well for everybody, so the [[teams|teams]] get less autonomous and agile

It's also easy to lose focus of "the shape" of the architecture, as each team will have only one small piece in mind at a time
