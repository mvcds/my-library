A kind of [[Software Architecture]]

Either Backend-as-a-Service or Function-as-a-Service

The first consists of you having your application and relying on third parties for the backend of some specific activities such as authentication.

The other consists of lifting app the app into functions (short stateless containers) which integrates with other services

This architecture scales very easily if you can pay the price but normally locks you into some specific vendors.
