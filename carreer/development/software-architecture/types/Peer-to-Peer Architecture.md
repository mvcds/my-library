A kind of [[Software Architecture]] where _there is no central server_ and doesn't require constant connection, due to it, they are cost-effective

Due to it different peers should be able to dynamically discover each other (and we cannot count on fixed URLs or IPs)

When a central server is needed, it is only used to communicate when new peers have joined the network

But is code is far from trivial
