A kind of [[Software Architecture|architectural style]] because it defines constraints how the architecture is defined by using a well-know structure

# Tradeoffs
Good
- Strongly structured
- Almost universal and versatil
- Plenty of tooling

Bad
- Request per [[Entity]]
- Not as space efficient as [[Remote Procedure Call|RPC]]
