An "[[Abstraction]]-first" approach to diagramming [[Software Architecture]], where you zoom-in to the next level

1. [[System Context Diagram|Context]]
2. [[Container Diagram|Containers]]
3. [[Component Diagram|Components]]
4. [[Code Diagram|Code]]

It's not necessary to use them all, just the ones that make sense. In most case the two first are enough.
