aliases: [Partition Tolerance]

In the [[CAP theorem]], [[Partition Tolerance]] makes sure that the [[system]] continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of [[Message|Messages]] being dropped (or delayed) by the [[network]] between nodes

In practice, this is always present because we want our [[System|Systems]] to remain operational after a failure, so our problems resort into choosing a AP or a CP system.
