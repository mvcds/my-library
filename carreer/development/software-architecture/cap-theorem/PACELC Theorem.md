An extension of [[CAP theorem]] which states that in case of [[CAP Partition Tolerance|Partition Tolerance]] (P) in a [[distributed system]], one has to choose between [[CAP Availability|Availability]] (A) and [[CAP Consistency|Consistency]] (C) (as per the CAP theorem), but else (E), even when the [[system]] is running normally in the absence of partitions, one has to choose between [[Latency]] (L) and [[Consistency]] (C)

Eventual [[CAP Consistency|Consistency]] optimizes read latency
