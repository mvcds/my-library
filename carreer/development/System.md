A group of [[Entity|Entities]] interacting withing a giving [[Context]].

A system has some attributes #complement which can be attributed to it, and we can look to it from different angles and levels, which make us understand them differently every time.

Systems can be broken down into multiple subsystems, or belong to bigger systems, and in this latter case, they are just entities in a supersystem.
