aliases: [Object-Based Storage]
---

A [[Computer data storage]] that manages [[data]] as [[Object]]s.

Those objects typically consist of metadata, the data itself and an unique identifier.

Good for [[Unstructured Data]] because it optimizes for:

- interface which can be programmed upon
- namespaces spanning multiple physical instances
- data replication and distribution

Services like Facebook, Dropbox and Spottily use this kind of storage for photos/videos, file synchronization and songs, respectively.
