# Layers

![[The 5 Ss of UX]]

# Principles
- Clarity comes first
- Provide clear, meaningful feedback
- Consistency matters
- When in doubt, use established [[Design Patterns]]
- Use visual hierarchy

# Be aware of:

![[Experience Awareness]]

# How?

1. Simplicity + Logic
2. Layout + Flow
3. Affordance
4. Demographics of the target audience + use cases

# Considerations

- [[Usercentric Design]]
- Desirability
- Feasibility (when using our product that requires [[internet]] connection, will our users have access to the internet?)
- Viability (can we afford to do what we need to do, is this the [[Design]] correct for what we're trying to achieve?)
