A collection of _[[Glyph]]_ definitions, ie. definitions of the shapes used to display [[Character]]s.

Once your[[Software]] has worked out what characters it is dealing with, it will then look in the font for glyphs it can use to display or print those characters. (Of course, if the [[Encoding]] [[Information]] was wrong, it will be looking up glyphs for the wrong characters.)
