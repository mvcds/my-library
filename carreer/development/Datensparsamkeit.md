A [[German]] word that's difficult to translate properly into [[English]]. It's a mindset that tell us that we should only capture and store [[data]] we need.

We might be tempted to capture everything (hello [[Big Data]]) just in case we need that data point later because storage is super cheap but by doing so, we might be violating our user's [[Privacy]].

Even if we don't exploit their data, someone else stealing from us can do so. And not only this can have legal repercusions but it is also a blow for reputation.
