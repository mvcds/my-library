The **state** of an [[carreer/development/programming/security/identity/Identity#Noun|identity]] is the [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|Value]] **currently** associated with this identity.

State never changes. At different times, different [[my-library/carreer/development/Value|Values]] are associated with an identity. We say that an identity can be in different states at different times.
