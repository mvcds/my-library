By [[Kent Beck]]

[[Controllability]] is the result of a [[tradeoff]] between the [[money|cost]] and the required [[flexibility]] of the [[Testing|Tests]], so to make software controllable, pass concrete [[Parameter|Parameters]] when tests don't need much flexibility and pass abstract parameters when they need more flexibility.

- [[The two economic imperatives of software development]]
- [[For software to be testable, it must be controllable and observable]]
