aliases: [NPS]

A methodology for measuring satisfaction. Created by [[Fred Reichheld]] in 2003. It can be used internally or externally e.g. with [[Customer|Customers]].

Calculate your NPS using the answer to a key question, using a 0-10 scale: How likely is it that you would recommend \[brand\] to a friend or colleague?

Respondents are grouped as follows:

-   **Promoters** (score 9-10) are loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others, fueling growth.
-   **Passives** (score 7-8) are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings.
-   **Detractors** (score 0-6) are [[happiness|unhappy]] customers who can damage your brand and impede growth through negative word-of-mouth.

Subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters yields the Net Promoter Score, which can range from a low of -100 (if every customer is a Detractor) to a high of 100 (if every customer is a Promoter).
