A way to organize [[tactic|tactical]] and [[strategy|strategical]] initiatives in an independent fashion within a [[business|company]].

Prerequisites
- Focused and achievable [[my-library/carreer/achieving-goals/Objective|Objective]]
- Minimum number of volunteers (3) to work (full) time on it

The members of the initiative have full authority, responsability and accountability to reach its objective. They also set an aspirational completion date (before put it in progress, and it can change).

The initiative gets blocked if one of the pre-requisites gets invalid.

Regularly, there should be updates of the initiative to the rest of the company. Any decisions of the members should also be communicated.

People can raise concerns and suggestions to the members, but they are not expected to address them. Those people can create their own initiatives to address those.
