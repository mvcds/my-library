> Don't [[trust]] the front-end

In every form imaginable: mobile, [[World Wide Web|Web]], or [[Command Line Interface|CLI]], the front-end can always send bad [[data]], maliciously or not.

To make sure the back-end does not handle compromising data, it has always to assert what it receives before using it. Especially with [[3 - Input Validation|ingress data]] from out of the [[system]].
