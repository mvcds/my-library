> [Most scope changes] will have an underlying reason [we] will never know about

#quote  from [[Tom Greever]] on [[Articulating Design Decisions]] #paraphrased about how we often associate stakeholders' [[behaviour]] to their personality when often their behaviour is situational[^1].

The example he gives is about a stakeholder who changed everything without an explanation. And some time later he founded out that they had had their budget cut in half, so had to simplify the project.
