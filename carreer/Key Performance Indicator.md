Some KPIs are dictated by a sector. Others are specific for a company.

A good KPI provides objective and clear information of progress towards an end [[goal]]. It tracks and measures factors such as efficiency, [[quality]], timeliness, and performance while providing a way to measure performance over [[time]]. The ultimate goal of a KPI is to help management make more informed decisions.
