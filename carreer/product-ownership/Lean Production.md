There are 5 principles

1.  Value - Specify the value desired by the customer. "Form a team for each product to stick with that product during its entire production cycle", "Enter into a dialogue with the customer"
2.  The Value Stream - Identify the value stream for each product providing that value and challenge all of the wasted steps (generally nine out of ten) currently necessary to provide it
3.  Flow - Make the product flow continuously through the remaining value-added steps
4.  Pull - Introduce pull between all steps where continuous flow is possible
5.  Perfection - Manage toward perfection so that the number of steps and the amount of time and information needed to serve the customer continually falls
