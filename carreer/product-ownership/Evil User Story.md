We normally think users try to squeeze the best of our functionalities but in reallity we might have users trying to harm the product.

A strategy to tackle that is creating [[User Story|user stories]] that describe what they want to do inside the product but we do not, like breaches to [[Information Security|Security]].

Those stories normally are not added to the backlog but are used to discuss how to improve the product against some [[Persona]]s e.g. hackers, former employees; and then those ideas go to the backlog.

Your requirement gathering process must go beyond considering the desired features. Every time a feature is described someone should spend some time thinking about how that feature might be unintentionally misused or intentionally abused
