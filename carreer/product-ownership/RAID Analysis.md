A [[project]] [[planning]] technique for identifying key project [[Risk|Risks]] (R), Assumptions (A), Issues (I), and Dependencies (D) #acronym

RAID analysis focuses on four key areas:

- **Risks** – events that can have an adverse impact if they occur.
- **Assumptions** – things you assume are in place which contribute to the success of the project.
- **Issues** – current matters that need to be considered and addressed by the group.
- **Dependencies** – other projects or triggers that your project depends on, or are a beneficiary of your project outcomes.
