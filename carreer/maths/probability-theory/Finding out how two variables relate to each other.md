For this you use the **covariance**formula to obtain a value.

We can use **correlation** to intepret the covariance numbers as they might be on completely different scales.

It's also important to understand the **causality**[^1] i.e. the direction of the influence.

A common practice is to disregard correlations smaller than `0.2`:

- Bigger than 0: variables relate to each other
- Equal to 0: variables are independent
- Smaller than 0: variables are opposed to each other
