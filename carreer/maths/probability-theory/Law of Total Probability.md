![[law-of-total-probability.png]]

A fundamental rule relating marginal [[Probability|probabilities]] to conditional probabilities.

It expresses the total probability of an [[carreer/maths/probability-theory/Event|outcome]] which can be realized via several distinct eventsâ€”hence the name.

`P(X) = P(X | a1) x P(a1) + ... + P(X | an) x P(an) `
