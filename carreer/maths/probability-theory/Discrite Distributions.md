[[Distributions]] that deal with finite [[carreer/maths/probability-theory/Event|outcomes]] i.e. each outcome has a [[probability]] attached to it[^1]

**Types**

- Uniform: all outcomes have equal probabilities and thus you cannot derive much information from them alone e.g. rolling one dice
- Bernoulli: only two possible outcomes, so one cancels the other at the same time that it allows us to predict the other outcome
- Binomial: a sequence of many Bernoulli events can be used to predict how many times you'll get the same outcome e.g. how many days out of 5 a stock go up (given that their price can only increase or decrease). [[Combination]]s can be used to describe how many favorable outcomes are available.
- Poisson: to find the frequency that an event occurs over [[time]]  (there's no negative time) e.g. heartbeats/minute. Its mean and variance are equal and they equal to the lambda used to calculate the frequency, which requires using the [[Euler's number]].
