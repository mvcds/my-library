The part or parts of your life which the [[Goal]] improves while or after being accomplished. A [[Habit]] can also be associated to the life aspects because of the close relationship between goals and habits.

There are many ways to enlist life aspects, none and all are correct at the same [[time]]. 

So i've created a chart like the following

|Group|Aspect|Label|
|---|---|---|
|Health|Mind|Health/Mind|
|Health|Body|Health/Body|
|Health|Self-Care (Wellbeing)|Health/Self-Care (Wellbeing)|
|Wealth|Career|Wealth/Career|
|Wealth|Finance|Wealth/Finance|
|Relationships|Friendship|Relationships/Friendship|
|Relationships|Community|Relationships/Community|
|Relationships|Family|Relationships/Family|
|Relationships|Romance (Date & Sex)|Relationships/Romance (Date & Sex)|
|Happiness|Recreation|Happiness/Recreation|
|Happiness|Serenity|Happiness/Serenity|
|Happiness|Spirituality (Religion)|Happiness/Spirituality (Religion)|
|Transversal|Legal|Transversal/Legal|
|Transversal|Organisational|Transversal/Organisational|
|Transversal|Household|Transversal/Household|
