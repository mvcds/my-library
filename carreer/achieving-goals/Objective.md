aliases: [Objectives]

Something that we have to do in order to achieve one or many [[Goal|goals]].

You can objectively answer if you have achieved it or not because they have a [[carreer/achieving-goals/Metric|metric]] associated with that.

A set of objectives can coexist in different way within the same [[Goal]]:

- Non-Related: achieving it does not influence others
- Competing: achieving it makes blocks the others
- Sequential: achieving it "unlocks" the others

The relationship between objectives vary according to [[Goal]] i.e. two competing objectives in [[Goal]] A might be non-related in [[Goal]] B
