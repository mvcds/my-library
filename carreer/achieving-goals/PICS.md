A [[Goal]] is a statement that describes precisely what you want to achieve. Goals are more useful if they are Framed in a Positive, Immediate, Concrete and Specific (PICS) format;

- Positive: your goal should be something you move toward, not away from.
- Immediate: your goals should be something that you decide to make progress on now, not “someday.”
- Concrete: it means that you’re able to see results in the real world. Achieve “happiness” is not a concrete goal.
- Specific: you have to define what, when and where you are going to achieve your goal. Your goals should be under your control, like “20 minutes of exercise” instead of “lose 20 pounds.”
