An [[Abstraction|abstract]] idea that you want to achieve. Such achievement seldom happens by chance, so you have to take some active steps towards it.

Depending on your goal, you'll have different ways to evaluate if you have achieved it. For instance "writing a book", though not a simple process, requires way more an empirical observation than "be happy" - which is subjective.

Often, a goal is composed by many [[Objective]]s, which can be summarized as a checklist of things to do.

It's vital to understand that a goal is not a solution, this allows you to show the same goal to different people and have them (withing their are of expertise) think about the best ways to get there.
