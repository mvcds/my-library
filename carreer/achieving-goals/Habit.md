As it's mentally expensive for animals to do new stuff, evolution has equipped us with habits: automation of our own [[behavior]]s.

Some habits are bad, and you might make a [[Goal]] to get rid of them; but some are good to the point that you want to do them [[time|daily]].

In this framework, the most important thing you can do is develop the habit of [[Working Towards Your Goals]], which make habits a vital tool in our behavioral box.

Habits take around 66 days to form, so at the beginning you have to actively do them daily.
