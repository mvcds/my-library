This is the way [[Me|I]] achieve [[Goal]]s in the long term.

It was based on [[Lean Startup]], [[Agile]], [[Domain-Driven Design]] and [[Commander's Intent]], later I got to know about [[The GIST Framework]]

There are many things that we want to do with our lives, we want to achieve stuff. But more often than not, we get trapped into investing our [[time]] on things that actually have no real, deep meaning for ourselves.

And even when we get the time to do so, human nature works against us - we take our eyes off the game, we have emergencies, we get dragged into something more immediately appealing, etc.

Knowing about those traps is not enough to achieve your goals, you need to acknowledge them and make pursuing them a [[Habit]]. The most important one that you can acquire to achieve your goals is [[Working Towards Your Goals]].

Achieving our goals is a dynamic process because we change over time, so part of our job is to find time to reevaluate our goals according to the changes in our lives.

Given this constant work, it might seem counter-intuitive to have abstract ideas defined as "goals"[^1] but the abstract idea is just the beginning - by stating it properly we start to think about the required steps necessary to get there.
