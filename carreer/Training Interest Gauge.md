**This originally was posted on a training about
[ansiety during security traings](https://www.level-up.cc/before-an-event/psychosocial-underpinnings-of-security-training/2-anxiety-pressure-gauge/), the text here is inspired by it _but_ might not be 100% translatable to other kinds of trainings**

People enter a training with different levels of interests from a teacher/trainert perspective.

- Blue: not interested much on the subject
- Green: at a desired level of interest
- Orange: "over" interested on the subject (like slightly traumatized by it)
- Red: like orange but stressed about it

Such interests are also dynamic, for intance, someone on the blue zone of spectrum might produce questions that will bring green and orange to the blue zone[^1] due to [[Group cohesiveness|Group Cohesion]].

In genreal, as a teacher you want to read the room to reaise or lower the medium gauge of the audience. And for both cases, we need to trigger [[Emotion|Emotional]] responses.

[^1]: Due to stress [[Healthy people automatically regulate their own emotional state|people on the red zone can't change their interest alone]]
