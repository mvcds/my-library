A four-step approach to [[Prioritizing]] which project [[System Requirement|Requirements]] provide the best [[ROI]], usually used together with some [[timebox]]

The steps form the #acronym for
- Must have: if even one of those is not delivered, the delivery should be considered as a failure
- Should have: tho some "shoulds" might be as important as some "musts", they are not as critical - they can be delayed or even done in a different way
- Could have: desirable but not necessary, so typically included if time and resources permit
- Won't have: either dropped or reconsidered for inclusion in a later timebox
