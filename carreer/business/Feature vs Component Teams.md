A [[feature]] [[team]] is a development team that implements end-user [[functionality]] end-to-end. It contrasts a component team, which owns an architecture building block, for example, a layer, a sub[[system]], or a collection of components or services.

'ts a matter of vertical vs horizontal focus[^1]

Features teams allow you to move fast, add new functionality, respond to user [[feedback]], and adapt your product. This makes them better suited for coping with innovation, uncertainty, and changeâ€”challenges that are present at the early life cycle stages and a life cycle extension. Component teams help you reduce cost and increase profitability by maximizing reuse and ensuring architecture integrity. This is desirable for mature and declining products, where you typically focus on incremental enhancements and bug fixes, and cost reduction. Consequently, it can be beneficial to change the team setup after a product has entered the maturity stage. But this should always be done with the agreement of the development teams.
