A [[Matrix]] that helps us assigning responsibility

Each row is a topic, and the headers are people/role. We mark resulting cells with one of the following:

- R for Responsible: who does the task
- A for Accountable: who ultimately answers for the task
- C for Consulted: who can have input on the discussion
- I for Informed: who we need to make aware
