During battles, the situation changes pretty quickly, so micromanagement is inefficient.

It's much better for commanders to inform their agents about their intents and allow them, in the heat of the battle, to figure out the best way to do it - this reduces communication friction and ensures that goals are met even in face of changes.

**By communicating the [[Militar Intent|Intent]] behind a certain plan, a leader can make constant communication less critical for the [[success]] of the entire team**
