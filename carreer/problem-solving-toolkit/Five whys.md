An iterative interrogative technique used to explore the [[Causality]] underlying a particular problem.

The primary goal of the technique is to determine the [[Root Cause]] of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?". Each answer forms the basis of the next question. The "five" in the name derives from an anecdotal observation on the number of iterations needed to resolve the problem.

Not all problems have a single[[Root Cause]]. If one wishes to uncover multiple root causes, the method must be repeated asking a different sequence of questions each time.
