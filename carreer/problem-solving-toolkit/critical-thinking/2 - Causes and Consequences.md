When facing a problem, we need to understand its causes, each can have causes on their own, you have to dig deep until you find the [[Root Cause]] of your problem in order to propose solutions.

Similarly, each proposed solution will have some consequences which can trigger different problems on their own. So we just need to make them clear for the people who are making the decisions.

We can use [[Issue Tree]]s to help us to dissect our problem.
