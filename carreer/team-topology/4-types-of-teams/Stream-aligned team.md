aliases: [Stream-aligned teams]

Aligned to a flow of work from (usually) a segment of the [[business]] [[Domain]] or organizational [[Feature|Capability]].

They own an entire slice of the business domain (or other flow) end-to-end, and follow the “You Built It, You Run It” mentality. There are no hand-offs to other [[team|teams]] for any purpose.
