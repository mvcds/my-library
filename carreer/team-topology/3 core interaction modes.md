There are only three ways in which [[4 types of teams|topological teams]] should interact:

-   Collaboration: working together for a defined period of time to discover new things (APIs, practices, technologies, etc.)    
-   X-as-a-Service: one team provides and one team consumes something “as a Service”    
-   Facilitation: one , often an [[Enabling team]], helps and mentors another team
