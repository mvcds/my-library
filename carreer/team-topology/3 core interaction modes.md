There are only three ways in which [[4 types of teams|topological teams]] should interact:

- [[Collaboration]]: working together for a defined period of time to discover new things (APIs, practices, technologies, etc.)
- X-as-a-Service: one team provides and one team consumes something “as a Service”
- Facilitation: one , often an [[Enabling team]], helps and mentors another team

Such collaboration should be short-lived, otherwise the teams are actually co-owning work[^1]

[^1]: [[At some point collaboration starts giving us diminishing returns because it compromises autonomy and can overload teams]]
