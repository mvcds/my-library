First, use descriptive diagnostic analytics to clean and analyze [[data]] so you can summarize the data using reports, dashboards, and visualizations. With descriptive summaries, you can see how different variables relate to the [[carreer/development/data-science/Metric|Metrics]] you need to impact to solve the [[business]] problem.

Ex. A company looking to improve the profitability of a marketing campaign will use descriptive analytics to conclude that a lower price leads to move sales.

Next, use predictive analytics to build a [[Machine Learning|Machine learnign model]] that will use historical data sets to predict future data points.
