#concept

The [[my-library/carreer/development/programming/Process#Noun|Process]] of predicting [[time|how long]] it will take to complete a [[Task]] or [[project]] so to plan and schedule the work that needs to be done, and to allocate [[Asset|Resources]] appropriately.

Note that estimation can happen in many ways, including not using time as its main [[Measure]] because we often use "perceived [[Complex|Complexity]]" as a guideline instead.

Not a [[science]], so not always possible to predict time and effort required. The more precise the estimation, the longer it takes to make it, which represents an [[opportunity cost]].

They can be absolute (estimated items are independent) or relative (comparing estimated items with each other). Absolute is best when work is similar to what has been done, so we know what to expect.

# Choosing a Technique

If you need to estimate a small number of items, say, less than 12, consider:

- [[Dot voting]]
- [[Ordering protocol]]
- [[Planning poker]]

If you donâ€™t need numerical estimates, consider:

- [[T-shirt sizing]]
- [[Ordering protocol]]
- [[Big / uncertain / small]]

If you need to estimate many items quickly, say, 50 or more, consider:

- [[The bucket system]]
- [[TFB / NFC / 1]]
- Dot voting

If you need to have strong alignment and mutual understanding among those doing the estimating, consider:

- [[Planning poker]]
- Ordering protocol
- [[Divide until maximum size or less]]
- [[Affinity mapping]]

If your team is very new to Agile Estimation, consider:

- The bucket system
- Planning poker

If you need your estimates to inform a long-term plan, consider:

- The bucket system
- [[Affinity mapping]]
- Divide until maximum size or less
