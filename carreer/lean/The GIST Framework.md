A planning [[system]] based on [[Lean Startup]] and [[Agile]].

An #acronym for its main building blocks: Goals, Ideas, Step-projects, and Tasks. Each has a different planning horizon and frequency of change, and may use different tools to track, but together they constitute all the core planning any company and team needs to do.

# Goals

Used as in the same sense as my [[Goal]]s was inspired by [[Commander's Intent]] i.e. let people working on it figure out the best way to do it.

They are typically set for an horizon of one or more years — this is where we want to encourage long-term thinking.

They are defined at the beginning of the year and evaluated and adjusted every quarter — we don’t want to pursue stale goals.

# Ideas

Hypothetical ways to achieve the goals.

They should never be killed upfront, put into a prioritization deathmatched, favored by management, or chosen according to hype/pitch/politics. Instead:

- Collect all ideas in an Idea Bank, most commonly a spreadsheet or a [[database]] — all ideas are welcome and the bank can hold hundreds of ideas indefinitely
- Prioritize using evidence  (like [[RICE Priorization]] and [[Evidence Scores]])
- Put as many ideas as possible to the test in order of priority — that’s the job of Step-projects.

# Step-Projects

We break the bigger project behind the idea into small step-projects, each no more than 10 weeks long, and execute them one at a [[time]].

In accordance with [[Lean Production|Lean]]-Startup’s Build-Measure-Learn principle, each step-project is actually an experiment that tests the idea. In a [[success|successful]] progression we will put in each step-project a somewhat more complete version of the idea in front of more users for a longer duration of time.

Because step-projects are so small we avoid all the nasty side effects of long projects and we are able to test many more ideas in parallel with lower investment and with quicker learning. Ideas that don’t work get dropped early, ideas that work get more investment. No need for pitching or politics. The ability come up with an idea and see it come to life and tested in a matter of weeks is incredibly liberating and enjoyable for everyone involved.

# Tasks

This part of the system is well covered by agile planning tools, [[Kanban]] boards, [[Scrum]] and other modern dev project management techniques. Nothing needs to change at this level. The only difference is that the layers above are now agile as well and ready for change.
