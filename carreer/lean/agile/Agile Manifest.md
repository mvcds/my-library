An "answer" to the [[Waterfall Methodology]]

---

We are uncovering better ways of developing  
[[software]] by doing it and helping others do it.  
Through this work we have come to [[my-library/philosofy/Value|Value]]:

Individuals and interactions over [[my-library/carreer/development/programming/Process#Noun|Processes]] and [[tool|tools]]  
Working software over comprehensive [[documentation]]  
[[Customer]] collaboration over contract [[Negotiation]]  
Responding to change over following a [[Plan]]

That is, while there is value in the items on  
the right, we value the items on the left more.
