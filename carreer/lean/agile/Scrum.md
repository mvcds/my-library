An [[Agile]] framework with demarked roles and two [[Backlog|Backlogs]], one representing all possible things we'd like to do (Product Backlog), and another representing to what the team has commited to during the current [[Sprint]] (Sprint Backlog).

The roles are:
- [[Product Owner]]: responsible to bridge the development team with [[business]]' needs and wants
- [[Scrum Master]]: responsible to make sure everyone is doing their proper version of scrum
- [[Development Team]]: the [[Software]] workforce

Scrum also has a strong [[Feedback]]-mentallity seen in its many rituals:
- Daily: an opportunity ro replan
- Planning: marks the beggining of the sprint, where developers pick up items from the product backlog
- Demo: the chance to show progress to stakeholders
- Retrospective: the cahnge for the team to lean
