aliases: [Goal, Goals]

Used as in the same sense as my [[Goal|Goals]] was inspired by [[Commander's Intent]] i.e. let people working on it figure out the best way to do it.

They are typically set for an horizon of one or more years — this is where we want to encourage [[time|long-term]] thinking.

They are defined at the beginning of the year and evaluated and adjusted every quarter — we don’t want to pursue stale goals.
