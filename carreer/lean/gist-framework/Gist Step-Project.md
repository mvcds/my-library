We break the bigger project behind the [[Gist Idea|Idea]] into small step-projects, each no more than 10 weeks long, and execute them one at a [[time]].

In accordance with [[Lean Production|Lean]]-Startup’s Build-Measure-Learn principle, each step-project is actually an [[Hypothesis| experiment]] that tests the idea. In a [[success|successful]] progression we will put in each step-project a somewhat more complete version of the idea in front of more users for a longer duration of time.

Because they are so small we avoid all the nasty side effects of long projects and we are able to test many more ideas in parallel with lower investment and with quicker learning.

Ideas that don’t work get dropped early, ideas that work get more investment. No need for pitching or politics. The ability come up with an idea and see it come to life and tested in a matter of weeks is incredibly liberating and enjoyable for everyone involved.
