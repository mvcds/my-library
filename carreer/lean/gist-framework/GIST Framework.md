A planning [[system]] based on [[Lean Startup]] and [[Agile]].

An #acronym for its main building blocks: [[Gist Goal|Goals]], [[Gist Idea|Ideas]], [[Gist Step-Project|Step-Projects]], and [[Gist Task|Tasks]].

Each has a different planning horizon and frequency of change, and may use different tools to track, but together they constitute all the core planning any company and team needs to do.
