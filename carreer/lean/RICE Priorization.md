- Reach: how many people will this impact? (Estimate within a defined [[time]] period.)
- Impact: how much will this impact each person? (Massive = 3x, High = 2x, Medium = 1x, Low = 0.5x, Minimal = 0.25x.)
- Confidence: how confident are you in your estimates? (High = 100%, Medium = 80%, Low = 50%.)
- Effort: how many “person-months” will this take? (Use whole numbers and minimum of half a month – don’t get into the weeds of estimation.)[^1]

To calculate the score use $\frac{R * I * C} E$, prioritize the ones with higher score
