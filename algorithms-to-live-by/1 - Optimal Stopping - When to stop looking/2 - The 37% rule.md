A kinda of [[Algorithm]] to be applied in the [[Optimal Stopping]]. 

It has two phases, given a limited amount of time, for instance 30 days

1. Look: you despretentiously gather [[Data]] for 37% of that [[time]], which in our example would be 11 days
2. Leap: you grab the best first option than the previous

The 37% rule has a symmetrical success rate in of 37% so even when you choose the optimal [[strategy]], you still pretty bad at it
