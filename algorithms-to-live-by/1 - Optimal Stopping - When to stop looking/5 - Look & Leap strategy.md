"Look & Leap" is an [[Algorithm]] that can be used [[strategy|strategically]] for taking the best of the [[2 - The 37% rule]].

It has two phases, given a limited amount of time, for instance 30 days.

1. Look: you unpretentiously gather [[Data]] for 37% of that [[time]], which in our example would be 11 days
2. Leap: you grab the best first option after the best of your "look" phase
