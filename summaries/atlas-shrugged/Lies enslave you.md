> a [[lie]] is an act of self-abdication, because one surrenders one’s reality to the person to whom one lies, making that person one’s master, condemning oneself from then on to faking the sort of reality that person’s view requires to be faked. And if one gains the immediate purpose of the lie—the [[price]] one pays is the [[destruction]] of that which the gain was intended to serve. The man who lies to the world, is the world’s slave from then on.
