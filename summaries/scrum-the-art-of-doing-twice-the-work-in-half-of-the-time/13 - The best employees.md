So [[Joel Spolsky,]] who studied Eisenstat's discipline in the 80s and now has his own software company, compared the data with the grades people got.

He wanted to discover if there was any relation between [[time]] spent in a project and the student's grade. Curiously, there ain't.

Some people work fast and get a 10, others execute their task meticulous and get the same results.

The only difference is the hours they spend.

So, how can we apply this discovery in the business world? Well, if you are a manager, it seems that the best is not to hire only those who get a 10, but those who get it working during the least amount of time possible.
