Let's make 3 cycles of 6 minutes for creating paper airplanes.

The teams have a minute of each cycle to plan (P) how they will assemble, three to do (D) - build and test as many real flying planes - and, in the end, two minutes to verify (C).

To Deming, "Act" means change the way we work based in real results and real information extracted from the real environment.
