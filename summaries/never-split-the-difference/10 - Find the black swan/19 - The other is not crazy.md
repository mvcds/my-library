It's cheap to call someone crazy because when they make something we don't understand, we tend to think they are irrational[^1].

Undestanding this [[1 - Negotiation is a process of discovery|unveils]] more possibilites and increases their appretiation over the solution but for this they need to [[6 - Listening to the other|talk]].

Here are some common reasons that make us think the other is crazy:

- They are ill-informed: so they can't make optimal choices, so you need to give them more data
- They are constrained: either due to legal advice, previous agreements, avoiding setting precedences, not having the power to close the deal
- They have other interests: they are complying to needs and desires that you don't understand
