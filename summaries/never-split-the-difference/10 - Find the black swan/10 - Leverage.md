A leverage is [[information]] that allows you to maximize your [[Goal]] in a [[negotiation]].

It doesn't need to be real, it can be manufactured[^1] i.e. what matters is what they think you have.

Multiple inputs influence it: [[time]], [[2 - Our Drivers|necessity]] and competition. For instance, there are differences between selling a house when you **need** and when you **want**.

We have 3 different kinds of leverage

![[Positive Leverage]]
![[Negative Leverage]]
![[Normative Leverage]]
