Toxic positivity is also linked with societal issues in the US, like discrimination and inequality.

You might find it challenging to understand at first –  the author certainly did. But as she started researching these issues, she was shocked by just how powerful and pervasive toxic positivity really was. It runs deep, and it contributes to the suffering experienced by marginalized communities every day.

Let’s take racial inequality as an example. In positivity culture, people of color are not supposed to be too angry, negative, or abrasive. We’re also expected to celebrate positive stereotypes, like the “strong Black woman.” That might not sound like a bad thing – but maybe we should be questioning why Black women have to be strong in the first place. Why does society expect this?

Also, we can see something similar happening with the treatment of immigrants. They’re expected to be grateful; they’re discouraged from complaining. If immigrants aren’t [[happiness|happy]], society says they should “go back to where they came from.” Everyone is supposed to just get along and love each other, and there’s no room for negativity.

Do you see what’s happening here? Positivity is being used to “keep the peace.” And when you look closer, you see that it’s actually upholding oppressive structures and discouraging change. People with legitimate feelings and problems are being silenced.

When a person of color or an immigrant expresses their unhappiness, it’s as if they somehow threaten other people’s [[happiness]] – a right that must be protected at all costs, apparently. But maybe that person is right to complain, to make some noise. After all, negativity and anger are some of the most effective forces for societal change.

Clearly, positivity and the pursuit of happiness are convenient tools for keeping people quiet and submissive. It’s a huge problem. And once you start to look out for it, you see it everywhere.
