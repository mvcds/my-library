	- If you are certain that your users cannot or will not use a [[password]] manager, then you might need to reduce the length so they can remember their password, or you might start having the password-taped-to-the-monitor problem

	-   use a password manager
	-   randomly generate a long password, and
	-   don't reuse the password for another site
-   Don't prevent the user from pasting passwords into the password field. It makes many password managers unusable
