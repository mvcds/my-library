An [[Attacker]] can try brute forcing their way into a [[Software|Program]], to fight this we can layer many different ways of defensive mechanisms that would increase their [[Work Factor]].

If that sequence of failures repeats again, it might make sense to lock the account once again, this time sending an email to the account owner requiring them to unlock the account using a secret link.
