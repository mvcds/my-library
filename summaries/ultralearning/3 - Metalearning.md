aliases: [3 - How to start ultralearning, Metalearning Map]

We should start by learning how to [[knowledge|learn]] a subject rather than absorbing [[Information]] at ramdom, but rather establish the structure of it.

This give you an [[Optimal Stopping|optimal]] learning [[strategy]], and the recommended time is using about 10% of the time for metalearning.

# Mapping
The metalearning map is a breakdown of the subject into three categories, which come in different proportions, according to the subject:

- [[Concept|Concepts]]
- [[summaries/ultralearning/metalearning/Fact|Facts]]
- [[Procedure|Procedures]]

Each of this categories requires different [[tatic|tatics]], like learning a sport might have fewer facts but it requires lots of practice (procedures), so no techniques for memorizing is needed

With a map in mind, we can start [[4 - Benchmarking]]
