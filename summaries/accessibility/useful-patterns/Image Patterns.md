- Be as brief as possible but capture the creator's content when it comes to alternative text
- Not all images convey meaning, the alt can be empty
- An image (like a font icon) wrapped in an element like button might be insufficient to convey meaning, for those, `aria-label`[^aria] can be used in the wrapper
- Dynamic placement of images can cause bad contrast
