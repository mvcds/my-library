Keeping in mind what he has learned of [[Logic]], [[Geometry]], and [[Algebraic structure|Algebra]], he sets down the following rules: 

1. To never believe anything unless he can prove it himself;
2. To reduce every problem to its simplest parts;
3. To always be orderly in his thoughts and proceed from the simplest part to the most difficult;
4. And to always, when solving a problem, create a long chain of reasoning and leave nothing out.

He immediately finds this method effective in solving problems that he had found too difficult before. Still fearing that his own misconceptions might be getting in the way of pure [[Reasoning|reason]], he decides to systematically eliminate all his wrong opinions and use his new method exclusively.
