20th century [[Economics]]'s concern was about the role that government plays in economy.

The [[USSR]], which [[Lenin]] called "The enemy of empirialism" was an extreme of [[Communism]] with the market fully regulated by the government, so when the famine killed a lot of people it reflected very badly over this kind of regime.

Despite this, some come to believe that some level of government intervention should be acceptable because individuals (citizens or companies) might damage economy even without intention.

Others went to the other way and said [[6 - Prices regulated by the government are meaningless unless people know what money represents]], therefore [[Capitalism]] was the only [[rationality|rational]] option.

This was enforced by wealthy people showing off in comfortable lives like if they didn't have to work, what caused the workforce to aim for it and work harder to achieve it, even though it is not sustainable.
