A governamental program in Turkey(?) made the mistake of asking only to men what they need [[12 - The plough started it all|to improve agriculture]].

They got suprised when nobody adopted the measurements but dicovered later that women cared for other factors, more closely related to their main concerns, like preparing the terrainor how long a crop takes to cook.

Indian 3-stones ovens use biomass to cook, but their fumes for 3 hours is equivalent to 100 cigarettes a day.

There were some initiatives in the 60s to change to clean ovens but they stopped because the women collecting the wood were the biggest environmental issue at hand.

The new and safe ovens were hard to manage, demanded more fire (and thus working for getting wood), take longer to cook and changed how they should cook.

Naturally women resisted them, as it takes even more time of the little they have[^1.
