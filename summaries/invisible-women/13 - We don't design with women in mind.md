A governamental program in Turkey(?) made the mistake of asking only to men what they need [[12 - The plough started it all|to improve agriculture]].

They got suprised when nobody adopted the measurements but dicovered later that women cared for other factors, more closely related to their main concerns, like preparing the terrainor how long a crop takes to cook.

Indian 3-stones ovens use biomass to cook, but their fumes for 3 hours is equivalent to 100 cigarettes a day.

There were some initiatives in the 60s to change to clean ovens but they stopped because the women collecting the wood were the biggest environmental issue at hand.

The new and safe ovens were hard to manage, demanded more fire (and thus working for getting wood), take longer to cook and changed how they should cook.

Naturally women resisted them, as it takes even more time of the little they have[^1] it also changed the way people cooked in the region (Bangladesh?).

![[14 - The report recommendation was to fix the women rather than the stoves]]

On top of this rhe [[15 - Male-biased design|designers]] didn't consider the dynamics of a household

The new stoves would require more maintanance, a task dominated by men who wouldn't prioritize fixing the stoves because their wives would still have the old stove as backup - men kept the [[Purchase Authority]].

An independent organization from the India government realized that problem of the 3-stones oven (by talking to women) was related to their size, which varies in households but depends where in the world people live (kimd of biomass and stones available), (and the way wooden was chopped?)

They devised a device made od scrape metal (to reduce costs) that would absorb the fumes and could be customized to different ovens.
