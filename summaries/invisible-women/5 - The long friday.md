The long Friday was a Icelandic national strike where more than 90% of women didn't do any kind of job (paid or not), and went to rallies. In the following year there was a passed act for gender equality.

But in most countries women relationship with work is more [[complicated]].

As seem in [[4 - Gender neutral with urinals]], we do not give woman the work flexibilization that they need, especially when we consider that Financial [[System|Systems]] tend to ignore [[6 - Is woman unpaid work undervalued because we don't see it, or is it invisible because we don't value it?|unpaid work]], and some benefits can only be collected when the [[my-library/philosofy/Value|Values]] come from the same source.

Women normally have to have multiple income sources to make as much as men, so they get screwed twice: they have less money and many times can't use the same benefits.

Not only this, due to taking care of house, children, etc, they normally go to part part time jobs, which have worse payments, not to mention that for "educated" services (like in an office, as opposed to a waitress), they are pretty rare, so they'd earn less anyway.

On top of this women normally have less free [[time]] than men because of unpaid tasks plus the issue of transport discussed on [[3 - Can snow-clearing be sexist?]].

Even office policies have often are designed to promote those who work more hours, and can attend to social events - often [[1 - The default male]].  As those things take time that normally women are using with unpaid work, they don't benefit from it.

Even parental leaves are designed around this. Most countries offer fewer time than health authorities recommend (7 to 12 months) and/or paying only a fraction of the wage

Some even have policies designed to "give" parents a choice of who will be benefited (or less hurt) by the leave. Often the choice is made in ways that are favorable to the father, as he'll have more chances anyway

Ironically, finish and Icelandic policies are designed in ways that force the fathers to take leaves or they'll lose them - so they start to take them

And if a father gets involved in the child upbringing from beginning they are more likely to keep doing this through their lives

Some cultures, like Japanese, are too much focused on work, so employees are even informally penalized if they use their leaves

In recreation, children spaces tend to be opened, and boys tend to gang up, competing for space - and as girls are thought to "fight" boys back, they tend to stop using spaces like this.

Compartmentalizing those make girls more prone to join activities, and those tend to be less structured - as opposed to sports, to which courts are built.
