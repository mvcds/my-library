"We will rebuild" was a mainly man group that wanted to rebuild after hurricane Andrew. It totally missed women-prone facilities, favoring commercial ones[^1].

Women fled home due to male violence, and normally humanitarian missions are desigend by men that don't take that into account. Creating unsafe environments for vulnerable women.
