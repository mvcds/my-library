Meeting potential partners (for dates, a [[love|relationship]], or a [[sex|one-night hookup]]) is a big part of the drinking scene.

Alcohol can lower inhibitions and make it easier to talk to people you find attractive. However, in larger doses, alcohol interferes with sexual performance. Heavy drinking can result in difficulty maintaining an erection or ejaculating for male-bodied people, and decreased lubrication or ability to orgasm for female-bodied people.

For the best possible sexual experiences, limit alcohol intake or wait until you and your partner are both sober.

FUN FACT: In a recent survey, 73% of Cornell students who have had a positive sexual experience said: “I consumed no alcoholic drinks before my best sexual experience.”

Unfortunately, alcohol is involved in as many as 75% of sexual assaults nationally on college campuses.

The majority of perpetrators are male-identified.

Perpetrators often perceive a woman drinking to be a vulnerable target. Some use alcohol as a weapon, intentionally getting someone drunk in order to take advantage sexually. Studies show those who are even a little intoxicated are more likely to be victimized than those not drinking
