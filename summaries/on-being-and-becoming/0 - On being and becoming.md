A #summary about [[Existencialism]] by [[Jennifer Anna Gosetti-Ferencei]]

---

- Existentialists think you're responsible to get the life you want, and became what you want
- Existentialism being is eternal (identity), whereas becoming is mutable. We should be called "human becomings" not "human beings"
- Such mutuality is what give us freedom
- To live authentically we have to recognize others' freedom
