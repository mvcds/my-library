#summary of [[0 - Google OKR playbook]]

Acting on [[Commited OKR]]s and [[Aspirational OKR]] is different in terms of expectation, priorisation and [[Business Value]]

For example, that [[A commited OKR that fails to achieve a 1.0 by its due date requires a postmortem]] and that [[By design aspirational OKRs exceed the team's ability to execute them|we should not drop aspirational OKRs because of lack of proggress]]

It's also possible to have [[Hierarchical OKRs]]
