Advantages of active voide:

- Most readers mentally convert passive voice to active voice. Why subject your readers to extra processing time? By sticking to active voice, readers can skip the preprocessor stage and go straight to compilation.
- Passive voice obfuscates your ideas, turning [[sentences]] on their head. Passive voice reports action indirectly.
- Some passive voice sentences omit an actor altogether, which forces the reader to guess the actor's identity.
- Active voice is generally shorter than passive voice.
