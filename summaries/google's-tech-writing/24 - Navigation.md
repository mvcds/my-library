Providing navigation and signposting for your readers ensures they can find what they are looking for and the information they need to get unstuck.

Clear navigation includes:

- [[23 - Introductions matter|introduction]] and summary sections
- a clear, logical development of the subject
- headings and subheadings that help users understand the subject
- a table of contents menu that shows users where they are in the document
- links to related resources or more in-depth information
- links to what to learn next
- **Prefer task-based headings**: be sure to use terminology your reader already understands[^1]
  - Each heading should have a contextual introduction too
