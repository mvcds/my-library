The outline helps you move topics around before you get down to writing.

You might find it useful to think of an outline as the narrative for your document.

- Before you ask your reader to perform a [[task]], explain to them why they are doing it.
- Limit each step of your outline to describing a concept or completing a specific task.
- Structure your outline so that your document introduces information when it's most relevant to your reader. You can always include links or reference to "extra" information.
- Consider explaining a concept and then demonstrating how the reader can apply it either in a sample project or in their own work. Documents that alternate between conceptual information and practical steps can be a particularly engaging way to learn.
- Before you start drafting, share the outline with your contributors. Outlines are especially useful if you're working with a [[team]] of contributors who are going to review and test your document.
