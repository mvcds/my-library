Sample [[code]] should meet the following criteria:

- Build without errors.
- Perform the task it claims to perform.
- Be as production-ready as possible. For example, the code shouldn't contain any security vulnerabilities.
- Follow language-specific conventions.
- Tested
- Code that can be extended or customized in useful ways.
- Runnable
  - You might have to tell about dependencies
  - Adjustment to [[environment variable]]
  - Adjustment for [[IDE]]s
- Understandable
  - Pick descriptive class, method, and variable names.
  - Avoid confusing your readers with hard-to-decipher programming tricks.
  - Avoid deeply nested code.
  - Optional: Use bold or colored font to draw the reader's attention to a specific section of your sample code. However, use highlighting judiciouslyâ€”too much highlighting means the reader won't focus on anything in particular.
- Commented
  - when you must explain a lengthy or tricky concept, you should typically place the text before the sample program.
  - **If you must sacrifice production readiness in order to make the code shorter and easier to understand, explain your decisions in the comments.**
  - Keep comments short, but always prefer clarity over brevity.
  - Avoid writing comments about _obvious_ code, but remember that what is obvious to you (the expert) might not be obvious to newcomers.
  - Focus your commenting energy on anything non-intuitive in the code.
  - When your readers are very experienced with a technology, don't explain _what_ the code is doing, explain _why_ the code is doing it.
