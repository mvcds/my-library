- Label each column with a meaningful header. Don't make readers guess what each column holds.
- Avoid putting too much text into a table cell. If a table cell holds more than two [[Sentence|Sentences]], ask yourself whether that information belongs in some other format.
- Although different columns can hold different types of data, strive for parallelism _within_ individual columns. For instance, the cells within a particular table column should not be a mixture of numerical data and famous circus performers.
- Some tables don't render well across all form factors. For example, a table that looks great on your laptop may look awful on your phone.
