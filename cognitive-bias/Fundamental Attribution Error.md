A.K.A. FAE, Correspondence Bias, Attribution effect

A [[Cognitive Bias]] where we under estimate other's persons behavior as if this defined their character (the guy that cut me off while I was driving is a jerk) and can logically explain our behaviors because we know ourselves (I would miss my fly if I didn't cut that car off)

---

We tend to see ourselves as protagonists and everybody else as a coadjuvant

---

This bias might be culture-dependent
