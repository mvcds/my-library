-   [[Browser]] [[Cache|caches]] can really mess with your [[authorization]] model when users share browsers. Make sure that you set the Cache-Control header to "private, no-cache, no-store" for resources so that your server-side authorization code is called every time.
-   You will inevitably have to make a decision whether to use a declarative or imperative approach to validation logic. There is no right or wrong here, but you will want to consider what provides the most clarity. Declarative mechanisms like the annotations that Spring Security provides can be concise and elegant, but if the authorization flow is complicated, the built-in expression language becomes convoluted and, arguably, you're better off writing well-factored code.
-   Try to find a solution, whether custom or framework-based, that consolidates and reduces duplication of authorization logic. If you find your authorization code is scattered arbitrarily throughout your codebase, you are going to have a very hard time maintaining it, and that leads to security bugs.
