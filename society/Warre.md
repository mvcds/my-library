A position where a contract _could_ be broken, even if it remains unbroken. “Warre” is the natural state of things, and peace is a position defended by the social contract of everybody else as well as by [[Leviathan]].

---

The term was coined by [[Hobbes]] because it's a similar (or incorrect) spelling of [[War]]
