  - Software Faults

One of the snakiest of the [[Tree types of faults]].

They can compound and cascade, that is, a [[carreer/development/programming/Service|Service]] becoming unresponsive triggers a [[designing-data-intensive-applications/concepts/three-types-of-faults/Failure]] somewhere else.

#fact: They can go unnoticed because they might happen only in specific conditions that were not foreseen. In other words, assumptions about the [[environment]] were wrong - maybe in function of things changes over [[Time]].
