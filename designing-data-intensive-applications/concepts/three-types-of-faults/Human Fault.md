One of the most common [[Tree types of faults]]

[[Human|Humans]] are not [[Reliability|reliable]] even when they have good intentions.[^1]

Most of human faults have to do with misconfigurations. And they are [[Coupling|Decoupled]] from the [[Time]] and place from the [[Failure|Failures]] they case, making it hard to see them but when we're training or managing.

That's one of the reasons why having similarly configured [[environment|environments]] is important (sandboxes).

#fact: Human faults cause the double of [[Failure|Failures]] than [[Hardware Fault|Hardware Faults]]
