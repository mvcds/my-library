#concept and #fact in [[1 - Reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications]]

Not [[Scalability|scaling]] properly can cause [[Reliability]] problems which impacts [[Performance]][^1] which impacts [[User perception]], specially if we're looking at it over [[Time]] (it was reliable for its size, and then the size grew).

Scalability is not general, it needs to be applied according to the [[Software|Application]]'s specific way of growing, that is, saying that "something is scalable" is not enough as it's incomplete [[maths/information-theory/Informational Entropy|Information]] without knowing the type of [[System]] and how much grow we're dealing with - and other stuff.

![[Each kind of system has metrics about how it's being]]
