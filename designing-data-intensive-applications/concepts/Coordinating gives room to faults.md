#concept and #fact in [[1 - Reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications]]

Coordinating [[System|Systems]] gives room for [[Fault|Faults]], so we better anticipate and cope with them to create a [[Reliability|Reliable]]/[[Fault Tolerance|Fault-Tolerant]] [[System]]. There are [[Three types of faults]] that we need to take care of.

Another source of reliability problems is [[Not scaling properly can cause reliability problems|not Scaling Properly]], which impacts [[Performance]][^1] which impacts [[User perception]]
