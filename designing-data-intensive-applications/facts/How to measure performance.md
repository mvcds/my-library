#fact and #procedure in [[1 - Reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications]]

[[Performance]] can be measured in terms of:

![[Taking the average of performing the same test is not a good performance metric]]

![[A client running a performance test needs to simulate multiple calls without waiting for the request to finish before sending the next]]
