We don't build [[Data Intensive Application|DIAs]] from the ground up, instead we use [[Building Block|Building Blocks]] and then [[It's up to the application to coordinate between different data systems|the bulk of our work is making sure they coordinate well]].

Increasing faults deliberately is a way to reduce failures
